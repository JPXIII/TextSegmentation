Sentence	1	Commander Ali Dizaei of London's Metropolitan Police Service today became the most senior officer anywhere in the United Kingdom to be convicted of offences by a court.
Sentence	2	Dizaei, who was branded a "criminal in uniform" by Independent Police Complaints Commission chair Nick Hardwick, has been jailed for four years after he attempted to frame an Iraqi businessman.
Sentence	3	It took a Southwark Crown Court jury under three hours to find Dizaei guilty of misconduct in a public office and attempting to pervert the course of justice.
Sentence	4	The charges carried a maximum of life imprisonment.
Sentence	5	Dizaei, 47, who is head of the National Black Police Association, had gone to the Yas Persian restaurant, run by one of his friends, and taken his wife Shy with him.
Sentence	6	They then went to their car and struck up a conversation through its open window with the restaurant's manager.
Sentence	7	During this conversation they were approached by Waad al-Baghdadi, an Iraqi website designer in his twenties.
Sentence	8	He requested that Dizaei pay £600 that he owed Baghdadi, who had constructed his website.
Sentence	9	According to the Crown, this dispute had been ongoing for months and Dizaei had been attempting to intimidate Baghdadi.
Sentence	10	He told the Iraqi to depart when he entered the restaurant; although the businessman did, he stayed nearby and rang the 999 emergency number.
Sentence	11	The exact content of the argument that led up to this is unclear.
Sentence	12	Dizaei and his wife testified that Baghdadi was abusive and threatening, telling the officer he would "extract the money out of your throat" while the owner of the Yas said he was "a crook basically... His history ... everybody knows he's not a good gentleman," said owner Sohrab Eshragi.
Sentence	13	Eshragi said that the request Baghdadi leave the premises was due to concerns of trouble, claiming Baghdadi had been in a previous fight.
Sentence	14	Baghdadi denied the allegations and the court rejected Dizaei's version of events.
Sentence	15	—Restaurant owner's description of the man arrested by Dizaei
Sentence	16	While Baghdadi was making his emergency call, Dizaei arrested him and made a 999 call of his own.
Sentence	17	He requested assistence from other officers, and said that Baghdadi had assaulted him by stabbing his stomach with a shisha pipe.
Sentence	18	He maintained this account when police arrived and kept it up in written statements, but although Baghdadi was found to be carrying such a pipe examination of Dizaei's wounds by a police doctor concluded he had inflicted them upon himself.
Sentence	19	A Home Office pathologist questioned this finding for the defence.
Sentence	20	Dr. Nat Cary said it was based on a "fundamentally flawed approach," and that the injuries were consistent with Dizaei's version of events.
Sentence	21	He has helped investigate the assassination of former Pakistani PM Benazir Bhutto, and the death newspaper seller Ian Thomlinson, the latter of whom died during a G20 protest.
Sentence	22	The Crown further alleged that Dizaei told Baghdadi "I'll fuck your life... You think I don't know what you do in London...
Sentence	23	I'll find every single detail of your life in London."
Sentence	24	The prosecution case was presented by Peter Wright QC, who has prosecuted in trials over serial murders of Suffolk sex workers and a plot to bomb transatlantic airliners.
Sentence	25	He said that Dizaei's actions were a "wholesale abuse of power by a senior police officer for entirely personal and oblique motives."
Sentence	26	Judge Justice Simon said that Dizaei had committed a "grave breach of public trust" and told him "This sentence needs to send a clear message that police officers of whatever rank are not above the law."
Sentence	27	A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said outside the court that "He abused his power and ignored his responsibility," and that while corruption was unacceptable in any police officer it was particularly so in a senior member of the forces.
Sentence	28	"The public should have confidence that we will prosecute anyone, regardless of their position, if they commit serious offences.
Sentence	29	We believe justice has been served for the victim and the public."
Sentence	30	—Nick Hardwick of the Independant Police Complaints Commission
Sentence	31	"[I]f he [Dizaei] had been successful, Mr al-Baghdadi may have been sent to prison," noted Hardwick.
Sentence	32	"Mr al-Baghdadi has shown tremendous strength of character throughout this case ‑ from the moment he was confronted by Ali Dizaei, throughout our investigation, and finally when giving evidence at court.
Sentence	33	We are grateful for the confidence he placed in the IPCC and, as a result of that, justice has been done today."
Sentence	34	Dizaei has been a policeman for 24 years, and at one stage was rumoured to be destined to take control of the Metropolitan Police, although the Metropolitan Police Authority may now choose to end this career.
Sentence	35	His trial, which began this month, is his second this decade.
Sentence	36	He was prosecuted in 2003 but cleared of any wrongdoing.
Sentence	37	The incident with Baghdadi was in June 2008 and Dizaei has been suspended on full pay since September of that year.
Sentence	38	Hardwick said that "The greatest threat to the reputation of the police service is criminals in uniform like Dizaei."

Sentence	1	An eighty-eighth minute goal has given Gulf Cup champions Qatar a 1-1 draw with Japan in their 2007 AFC Asian Cup Group B match at the My Dinh National Stadium, Hanoi, Vietnam.
Sentence	2	Three-time champions and current defending champions of the Asian Cup competition, Japan scored in the sixty-first minute through prolific striker Naohiro Takahara.
Sentence	3	They held the lead for nearly half an hour before Sebastián Quintana levelled the scores at 1-1 for Qatar.
Sentence	4	Japan's goal was the result of a clever finish by Takahara after getting on the end of a Yasuyuki Konno cross from the left-hand wing.
Sentence	5	A series of passes around the edge of Qatar's penalty area ended up with a through-ball for Konno on the left, who precisely drilled his left-footed cross for Takahara to smartly strike on the half-turn into the net.
Sentence	6	Japanese midfielder Yuki Abe fouled Quintana two metres outside the box, and Quintana sweetly struck the ball to the right of the defensive wall and past Japanese goalkeeper and captain Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi on eighty-eight minutes.
Sentence	7	The drama-packed last few minutes included the goal as well as a straight red card against Qatar defender Hussain Yasser for a reckless tackle.
Sentence	8	Australian referee Matthew Breeze adjudged Yasser to have dangerously lunged at Japanese midfielder Hideo Hashimoto with the studs showing, collecting him both late and above the ball, two minutes into injury time.
Sentence	9	Qatar coach Džemaludin Mušović was sent away from the sideline by Breeze immediately following Yasser's dismissal, after overzealously protesting the referee's decision to send his player off.
Sentence	10	When Mušović initially failed to leave, the sideline-based fourth official intervened and he made his way to the grandstand.
Sentence	11	The result leaves underdog hosts Vietnam on top of Group B after their upset victory over the United Arab Emirates yesterday.

Article	191
Sentence	1	A researcher at the University of Oxford has found a saucy poem attributed to John Milton, the 17th-century poet who wrote Paradise Lost and other religious verse.
Sentence	2	"An Extempore Upon a Faggot", discovered in an 18th-century anthology of poetry, is not thought by modern scholars to be by Milton, however, and may in fact have been written by one of his rivals in an attempt to disgrace him.
Sentence	3	The poem was found by Dr Jennifer Batt, who said that it "is so out of tune with the rest of his work, that if the attribution is correct, it would prompt a major revision of our ideas about Milton."
Sentence	4	She discovered the rude verse in the Harding Collection of poetry anthologies held by the Bodleian Library, the main university library at Oxford.
Sentence	5	"To see the name of John Milton, the great religious and political polemicist, attached to such a bawdy epigram, is extremely surprising to say the least", she added.
Sentence	6	The book in question, the Oxford and Cambridge Miscellany from 1708 (over 30 years after Milton's death), was described by another Oxford academic, Dr Abigail Williams, as "a set of poems written by witty young men about town for witty young men about town".
Sentence	7	Milton wrote in blank verse rather than using rhyme and used differing poetic rhythms, whereas the handwritten poem uses a simple pattern of rhyming couplets as it contrasts the sexual behaviour of young women and more experienced women by comparing them to green wood and dry wood upon a fire.
Sentence	8	Have you not in a Chimney seenA Faggot which is moist and greenHow coyly it receives the HeatAnd at both ends do's weep and sweat?
Sentence	9	So fares it with a tender MaidWhen first upon her Back she's laidBut like dry Wood th' experienced DameCracks and rejoices in the Flame
Sentence	10	Milton (1608–1674) wrote many influential religious poems, including Paradise Lost, which is described by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as "widely and rightly regarded as the supreme poetic achievement in the English language, fit to sit alongside the poems of Homer, Virgil, and Dante."
Sentence	11	It tells the story of the fall from grace of Adam and Eve in an epic theological poem.
Sentence	12	He followed it with Paradise Regained, depicting the temptations of Jesus in the wilderness.
Sentence	13	Bawdy poetry is not thought by modern academics to be in keeping with Milton's style, with Batt suggesting that it is likely that his name was added to the poem "to bring scandal upon [him], perhaps by a jealous contemporary."
Sentence	14	She suggests that the culprit might have been Sir John Suckling, a poet who was a supporter of the monarchy, in contrast to the Republican Milton.
Sentence	15	The University of Oxford is currently digitising the songbooks and anthologies of the Harding Collection, said to be the world's largest such collection, as part of a project to allow online access.
Sentence	16	It is named after Walter Harding, a British musician who collected music and poetry in Chicago.
Sentence	17	The poem had been read before, but without anyone noticing Milton's name at the bottom.
Sentence	18	Dr Williams, the project's leader, expressed her doubts as to the authenticity of the attribution, commenting that "[y]ou could become very rich and famous – well, famous, anyway – if you could prove the rhyme was really by Milton.
Sentence	19	I am pretty certain it is not."

Article	376
Sentence	1	 James Tobin, a Republican who worked as a regional political director for the RNC-affiliated National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, has been charged with conspiracy to deny New Hampshire Democrats the right to vote among three other conspiracy charges.
Sentence	2	Prosecuters say Tobin conspired with state GOP official Charles Mcgee and consultant Allen Raymond in Virginia, both of whom are cooperating with prosecutors, to have the consultant's telephone firm make repeated hang-up calls to Democratic and labor union get-out-the-vote phone banks, effectively jamming their phone lines.
Sentence	3	The New Hampshire Republican State Committee paid $15,600 to the firm.
Sentence	4	Callers requesting transportation to polling places were thus unable to receive any, allege prosecutors.
Sentence	5	Republican John Sunonu won a close US Senate race in New Hampshire following the phone-jammings which occurred in November 2002.
Sentence	6	The RNC has been paying Tobin's legal fees, which have so far amounted to $722,382.
Sentence	7	The RNC did not specify that the payments were for Tobin's defense in reports with the FEC, but has since confirmed that they were.
Sentence	8	RNC Chairperson Ken Mehlman said in a May 18, 2005 statement that he "strongly support[ed]" a "zero-tolerance policy" on election fraud.
Sentence	9	[1] Some have therefore criticized the GOP for making the payments to the powerful Williams and Connolly law firm.
Sentence	10	But on August 10, 2005, RNC spokesperson Tracey Schmitt said their support of Tobin through payment of his legal fees is "based on his assurance and our belief that Jim has not engaged in any wrongdoing.
Sentence	11	"[2]
Sentence	12	Tobin's involvement is said to have been finding the firm to make the calls.
Sentence	13	Raymond told prosecutors Tobin explained the scheme to him and asked him to implement it, and his lawyers said that he had believed Tobin was acting under RNC sanction in his then capacity as policial director for New England.
Sentence	14	Tobin went on to work for the president's re-election campaign.
Sentence	15	Paul Tworney, a volunteer lawyer for New Hampshire Democrats said the RNC's actions suggested more people may be involved.
Sentence	16	"It originally appeared to us that there were just certain rogue elements of the Republican Party who were willing to do anything to win control of the U.S. Senate, including depriving Americans of their ability to vote.
Sentence	17	But now that the RNC actually is bankrolling Mr. Tobin's defense, coupled with the fact that it has refused some discovery in the civil case, really raises the questions of who are they protecting, how high does this go and who was in on this," said Twoney.
Sentence	18	[3]
Sentence	19	The New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairperson Kathy Sullivan demanded that the state Republican Chairperson Warren Henderson resign.

Sentence	13	It is just awful... the smell is horrible,"
Sentence	14	The causes of the incident are under investigation, with an official inquiry already begun, although Italian rail unions, are already blaming outdated rolling stock, according to BBC News.

Sentence	1	The man known as just the 'Piano Man' has left the hospital where he was staying and has returned home to his native Germany.
Sentence	2	He has finally spoken after four months of silence.
Sentence	3	It turns out, according to British tabloid The Daily Mirror, that the man, aged 20, was from Germany but after losing his job in Paris, traveled to the UK through the Channel Tunnel.
Sentence	4	He was going to commit suicide when he was found by police on a Kent beach.
Sentence	5	He refused to talk to authorities due to his distressed state.
Sentence	6	It appears that he had formerly worked with mental patients and copied what he saw from them to fool the doctors.
Sentence	7	Also according to the Mirror, the man was only able to tap the same piano key repeatedly, but hospital officials refute this.
Sentence	8	However, all of this information came from a single, unidentified source.
Sentence	9	The man was found soaking wet on a beach in Kent in an expensive-looking suit from which all the labels had been removed.
Sentence	10	Some people believed he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or that he was an autistic savant.
Sentence	11	Some also believed he was a Canadian eccentric, a French busker, a student from Norway, or Czech concert pianist Tomáš Strnad.

Article	249
Sentence	1	The United States announced the arrest of eleven people accused of acting as spies for Russia, breaking up what the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) called a "long term, deep cover" spy ring within the US.
Sentence	2	Those arrested were, according to the US government, members of a spy ring that had existed for several years, involving Russian agents adopting civilian identities.
Sentence	3	All are charged with acting as unlawful agents for Russia, which carries a sentence of a prison term up to five years.
Sentence	4	Nine were charged with money laundering, a crime that carries a prison term of up to twenty years.
Sentence	5	According to the US government, the suspects had been trained by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service to obtain information about US military policies, including those concerned with nuclear weapons, as well as intelligence about leadership at the CIA and the White House.
Sentence	6	The FBI said that to obtain those objectives, the suspects were instructed to live as American citizens under false names, some as married couples.
Sentence	7	Some suspects were able to achieve ties with prominent US citizens, including a scientist working with nuclear weapons and a New York financier who had ties to officials within the US government.
Sentence	8	Communication with Russian authorities was allegedly via several disparate methods, including unique wireless internet connections or pictures posted on the Internet with hidden messages, as well as more traditional methods such as burying messages or swapping bags between agents.
Sentence	9	The Russian Foreign Ministry told the AFP that they are investigating the allegations, but say that "there are a lot of contradictions."
Sentence	10	No further comment has been made.
Sentence	11	Names in quotes are cover names, while those not in quotes are real names of the alleged agents.
Sentence	12	Couples are on the same bullet, while those living alone are separate.
Sentence	13	Locations are where the suspects were arrested.
Sentence	14	A preliminary hearing is scheduled for July 27.

Sentence	1	Atheists, secularists, and supporters of free speech rallied in London today to protest what they feel is an "increased confidence of Islamists to censor free expression publicly".
Sentence	2	Around 200 people gathered on the steps of the memorial to King George V in Old Palace Yard opposite the House of Lords in Westminster.
Sentence	3	Anne Marie Waters from the 'One Law for All' group, which protests against sharia law in the United Kingdom, said that freedom of expression was "the greatest freedom we have" and included "the freedom to offend".
Sentence	4	Accusations of Islamophobia against those who reposted the Jesus and Mo webcomic was one of a number of incidents highlighted by speakers.
Sentence	5	Susan Zhuang from the University College London Atheist, Secularist and Humanist society spoke of the reaction to the posting of the cartoon to their Facebook profile: "maybe we were naive but we never thought it would come to this".
Sentence	6	The university's student union demanded that the group remove the cartoon, but the group declined and launched an Internet petition to "defend freedom of expression".
Sentence	7	The blogger and activist Rhys Morgan, who had been previously threatened with libel for saying that a clinic operated in Texas by Stanislaw Burzynski was charging hundreds of thousands of dollars to cancer patients for unproven treatments, also spoke of being threatened by his sixth-form college to remove the Jesus and Mo cartoon from his Facebook account.
Sentence	8	He said that the staff at his college "implied that [he] would be suspended or expelled", claiming that the image offended Muslims.
Sentence	9	He also said that he had got threats of violence including someone saying that his house would be burned down, and was called a "God-hater".
Sentence	10	The philosophy professor A. C. Grayling and the popular science writer Richard Dawkins both spoke at the rally, with the latter criticising the decision by the organisers of a literary festival in Jaipur, India, to "kowtow to a violent threat" by rescinding an invitation to the author Salman Rushdie based on a demand by "some local Islamic scholar".
Sentence	11	(Dawkins joked about how, unlike Islamic scholars, "a true 'scholar' studies more than one book".)
Sentence	12	Dawkins argued that people should "stop being so damn respectful".
Sentence	13	Without freedom of speech, Dawkins said, society would be in a "scientific, technological, moral dark age".

Article	40
Sentence	1	The 108-floor central component of the new World Trade Center in New York City has been officially renamed 1 World Trade Center, ending the Freedom Tower moniker it had sported since 2003.
Sentence	2	Freedom Tower was envisioned as a symbol of America's victory over terrorism.
Sentence	3	It is currently on track for completion in 2013, with 10 floors partially finished so far.
Sentence	4	Port Authority Chairman Anthony Coscia commented on the change, "It's the one that is easiest for people to identify with — and frankly, we've gotten a very interested and warm reception to it."
Sentence	5	Former Governor George Pataki, who revealed the Freedom Tower name nearly six years ago, was critical of the switch, saying "The Freedom Tower is not simply another piece of real estate and not just a name for marketing purposes."
Sentence	6	1 World Trade Center has been the building's legal name and address for the past two years, with the public change precipitated by the ramp up of construction and the commencement of lease marketing.
Sentence	7	Mayor Michael Bloomberg seemed ambivalent to the change, saying "I would like to see it stay the Freedom Tower, but it's their building, and they don't need me dumping on it.
Sentence	8	If they could rent the whole thing by changing the name, I guess they're going to do that, and they probably, from a responsible point of view, should.
Sentence	9	From a patriotic point of view, is it going to make any difference?"
Sentence	10	The change was approved following the signing of a two-decades-long lease by a Chinese real estate company, which plans to occupy floors 64 through 69.
Sentence	11	Other future tenants include the U.S. General Services Administration and the New York State Office of General Services.

Article	312
Sentence	1	Cambridge University have defeated Oxford University by 1¼ lengths to win the 153rd Boat Race.
Sentence	2	The Light Blues won with a time of 17 minutes and 49 seconds to record their first win in three years.
Sentence	3	Oxford finished with a time of 18 minutes and 2 seconds.
Sentence	4	Oxford won the toss and chose to row on the Surrey side of the river, with Cambridge rowing on the Middlesex side.
Sentence	5	Oxford had the stronger start and were ahead for much of the first half of the race.
Sentence	6	They had a slight advantage over Cambridge at Hammersmith Bridge, where they would be favoured by racing the inside of the upcoming bend.
Sentence	7	However Cambridge never lost touch and pulled ahead at Chiswick steps, maintaining their lead for the remainder of the race.
Sentence	8	Before the race, Cambridge were strong favourites, being 9lb heavier per man on average.
Sentence	9	The Cambridge crew had 5 returning blues compared to Oxford's one.
Sentence	10	Furthermore the international achievement of Cambridge's rowers far exceeded that of Oxford: the World Champion stern pair of Germans Thorsten Engelmann (the heaviest ever oarsman at 110.8kg) and Sebastian Schulte, Olympic Gold medallist Kieran West MBE and GB medal winner Tom James.
Sentence	11	The heavily fancied Cambridge crew did not win by the margin expected by many, thanks in part to a strong row from Oxford, and the sagging stern containing the heaviest Cambridge oarsmen.
Sentence	12	Also of note, only a week before, Cambridge were victorious at the prestigious Head of the River Race (raced on the same course, but from Mortlake to Putney).
Sentence	13	However the race was abandoned due to weather conditions with only 29 out of 420 crews finishing.
Sentence	14	The race, first held in 1829, is currently held on a 6,779 m (4 miles and 374 yards) stretch of the River Thames in London from Putney to Mortlake.
Sentence	15	Overall, Cambridge lead Oxford by 79 wins to 73 with one dead heat.
Sentence	16	In the earlier race for reserve crews, Goldie (Cambridge) beat Isis (Oxford).
Sentence	17	Racing for the women's and lightweight crews took place at Henley on April 1st, where Cambridge won the Women's Boat Race and Oxford won the reserve women's, lightweight women's, lightweight men's and reserve lightweight men's races.

Article	301
Sentence	1	A Peruvian Air Force Twin Otter plane crashed on May 24 in Peru, killing at least 13 people.
Sentence	2	The plane was part of a service to help remote communities not served by commercial flights, and crashed shortly after takeoff in a thunderstorm in dense jungle 563 kilometres from Lima.
Sentence	3	The flight originated in Iquitos, capital of the region, and had flown on to Orellana, where it had just taken off from when the accident occurred.
Sentence	4	Survivors said after the crash that they had attempted to persuade the pilot not to takeoff in the adverse weather conditions, but they had been assured by Air Force personnel that they would be safe as they were on board a military aircraft.
Sentence	5	Survivor Juan Saavedra said that, on takeoff, the pilot immediately began struggling to control the plane in high winds.
Sentence	6	It then dropped and flew between two trees, shearing off its wings.
Sentence	7	Another survivor said that immediately prior to the crash the pilot gave an order to turn off the engine in a move that is speculated to have been intended to prevent a post-impact fire.
Sentence	8	Local officials said 20 people were on board, with police giving seven survivors and the Defence Ministry eight.
Sentence	9	No passenger list or official report has yet been released regarding the crash, but it is known that 13 bodies were recovered from the wreckage.
Sentence	10	Juan Montes, a police spokesman in the jungle village Contamana, supposed to be the aircraft's next stop, said that the plane had a three-man crew, all of whom were killed.
Sentence	11	Maria Luisa Armas, 93, the oldest resident of Contamana, is reported by survivors to have survived initially but insisted that other survivors leave her in the aircraft and go off to find help.
Sentence	12	She was one of the 13 deceased ultimately pulled out of the wreckage.
Sentence	13	The survivors were taken to Pucallpa, which was supposed to be the last stop on the flight.
Sentence	14	According to the state news agency, Andina, homes had been deroofed and trees felled by powerful winds earlier the same day.

Article	146
Sentence	1	Last week, Nature Genetics carried twin studies into the genetics of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.
Sentence	2	This special report examines the month's research into the illnesses in detail, with Wikinews obtaining comment from experts based in Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom ahead of the U.S.
Sentence	3	Mental Illness Awareness Week, which starts tomorrow.
Sentence	4	Eleven genetic regions were identified; seven of these were for schizophrenia and five of those were hitherto undiscovered.
Sentence	5	The parallel studies, conducted separately, examined more than 50,000 people worldwide and identified two genetic loci associated with both diseases.
Sentence	6	Little is known about the two illnesses, each of which affects around 1% of people and is treated with strong medication.
Sentence	7	Bipolar sufferers experience extremes of mood – depression and mania, hence the previous name “manic depression” for the illness.
Sentence	8	Schizophrenia is associated with hearing voices, chaotic thoughts, and paranoia.
Sentence	9	There is no known cure.
Sentence	10	The latest research examined both the healthy and the afflicted, using computers to scan genomes.
Sentence	11	Inheritance was thought to be a factor from prior knowledge of the diseases as a familial trait, but the original desire had been to isolate a single faulty gene.
Sentence	12	Instead it has become apparent that the genetic factors are many; in the case of schizophrenia, at most around 30% of the genetic components are thought to have been identified.
Sentence	13	—Rodney Scott
Sentence	14	The University of Chicago’s Pablo Gejman, a lead researcher on the schizophrenia study, explained to Wikinews in a telephone interview from Buenos Aires, Argentina that “One of the goals of genetic research is to find druggable targets” – to “find treatments at the root of the problem”.
Sentence	15	Whilst noting that there is no guarantee the genetic code identified is druggable, Gejman named calcium-activated neurochemical channels in the brain as candidates for new drugs.
Sentence	16	The channels were linked to schizophrenia in the study.
Sentence	17	Gejman explained that a genetic locus called mir137 “suggests an abnormality of gene regulation.” The diseases are so poorly understood that it is uncertain if they are in fact two components of a single spectrum, or even each comprised of multiple illnesses.
Sentence	18	The new and “provocative data” gathered showed the significant loci identified were “not part of the pre-existent hypothesis.” Calling this “interesting”, Gejman added that the team found  no evidence that dopamine receptors are involved; current drug treatments target dopamine receptors.
Sentence	19	The findings are “not related to anything we thought we knew [about schizophrenia],” he told our correspondent.
Sentence	20	Quizzed about the possibility variations in the genetic factors involved in expressing the diseases explained the variation seen in symptoms, Gejman was uncertain.
Sentence	21	“We will have the answer, probably, only when we sequence the whole [human] genome.” He notes that the relationship between genotype and phenotype is unclear, and that “We know very little of the genetic architecture of schizophrenia and” other disorders.
Sentence	22	At the time the results were published, participating scientist Professor Rodney Scott from the University of Newcastle in Australia said “The strength of this research is in the numbers.
Sentence	23	The findings are robust and give us a lot of statistical power to identify the genetic determinants of schizophrenia.” Scott told Wikinews that “If any single centre tried to undertake such a study, it would require millions of pounds.
Sentence	24	Since it was a collection of data from across the world the costs were spread.
Sentence	25	In this era of financial difficulty it will become increasingly difficult to secure funding for this type of project even though the pay-offs will be significant.”
Sentence	26	Gejman expressed similar sentiment.
Sentence	27	“The research budget is not growing, which makes [funding] difficult,” he said, though he felt the cost “is not prohibitive because of the benefits.” “I think that it was money well invested” and “very well spent for the future,” he said, adding that organisations in Europe and the US were aware of the importance of such research.
Sentence	28	Gejman also agreed on reliability – the study is “Very reliable because of the sample size; that should provide robust results… [we] have worked with a much larger sample than before.” Scott told us it was “a highly reliable study” that has the potential to lead to new treatments “in the long run”.
Sentence	29	Another point was the two genetic loci identified as common to both – how much support do they lend to the notion the diseases are linked?
Sentence	30	“Until more information is available it is really only suggestive,” says Scott.
Sentence	31	“Strong enough to say there may be potentially a common pathway that bifurcates to give rise to two diseases.”
Sentence	32	—Suzanne Hudson, Chief Executive of MDF The Bipolar Organisation.
Sentence	33	“It is an excellent demonstration,” said Gejman “because you have the same chains that are common to both disorders, in fact not just the same chains but also the same alleles.” He stressed uncertainty in how strong the relationship was, however.
Sentence	34	Scott said examining how the variation of genetic factors may translate into varied symptoms being expressed “certainly is a good target for future research”; “It is not known how many genetic factors contribute to either of these diseases but it is likely that not all are necessary to trigger disease.” “New questions will always arise from any major study,” he told our reporter.
Sentence	35	“Certainly, new questions about bipolar and schizophrenia are now able to be formulated on the basis of the results presented in the two reports.”
Sentence	36	These weren’t the only studies to look at the two diseases together in September.
Sentence	37	The British Medical Journal carried research by a team from the University of Oxford and King's College London that examined mortality rates in England for schizophrenia and bipolar sufferers.
Sentence	38	They found both groups continued to suffer higher mortality rates than the general population – whilst these included suicides, three quarters of deaths were down to ailments such a s heart conditions.
Sentence	39	General death rates dropped from 1999 to 2006, but sufferers below 65 saw their death rate remain stable – and the over-65 saw theirs increase.
Sentence	40	"By 2006, the excess risk in these groups had risk to twice the rate of the general population, whereas prior to that it had only been 1.6 times the risk, so it increased by almost 40%," said Dr Uy Hoang of Oxford.
Sentence	41	The study looked at every discharged inpatient with a diagnosis of either condition in England in the relevant time.
Sentence	42	Hoang said at the time of the research’s release that doctors should devote attention to predicting and preventing physical illness associated with mental disorders.
Sentence	43	His study comes at a time when the UK has launched a "no health without mental health" strategy which does attempt to screen for physical illnesses coinciding with mental illnesses.
Sentence	44	The government aims to reduce the death rate of those with mental disorders.
Sentence	45	Rodney Scott described this research result to Wikinews as “Possibly” connected to genetic association with other hereditary ailments, such as cardiovascular disease; he told us another possibility is that “The continued raised mortality rates may be associated with the diseases themselves.”
Sentence	46	“We believe the NHS [National Health Service] and Department of Health need to do more to support research and service development for people with bipolar disorder,” Wikinews was told by Suzanne Hudson, Chief Executive of London-based British charity MDF The Bipolar Organisation.
Sentence	47	“The provision of specialist services for bipolar is very limited in the UK and the demand for our services is unprecedented.”
Sentence	48	“A genetic test for bipolar would be a useful tool but the science and ethics are very complex,” Hudson told us, referring to the Nature Genetics genetic study.
Sentence	49	“Just because someone has 'bipolar genes' does not mean they might go on to develop it.
Sentence	50	Family studies of bipolar show that this is a likely outcome of genetics research in this area.
Sentence	51	Even if it were possible to accurately predict bipolar in this way, questions about how you treat that person are difficult.
Sentence	52	For example do you start medication that is not necessary at that point in time?”
Sentence	53	“Current treatment is not satisfactory” because it does not always work and has “side effects,” Gejman told us.
Sentence	54	Robert Whitaker, a US medical journalist and book author, told an audience in New Zealand at the end of August that evidence suggests antidepressant drugs may make children and teenagers worse – “You see many become worse and end up with a more severe diagnosis, like bipolar illness," and the suicide risk may increase.
Sentence	55	Whitaker blames commercial interests.
Sentence	56	"The adult market appeared saturated, and so they began eying children and teenagers.
Sentence	57	Prior to this, few children and youth were seen as suffering from major depression, and so few were prescribed anti-depressants."
Sentence	58	One possible alternative, raised by a connection between depressive illness and inflammation, is aspirin and similar compounds.
Sentence	59	“The link between inflammation and mood disorders has been known for sometime and the use of aspirin and other drugs in depression is now becoming more common in the literature,” Hudson says.
Sentence	60	“Any new treatments for bipolar, which is a very complex and co-morbid illness, has to be a good thing.”
Sentence	61	Professor Dr. Michael Berk, chairman of psychiatry at Australia’s Deakin University, recently gave a talk to just this effect.
Sentence	62	Speaking at this year’s Congress of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology, held this past month, he also highlighted statins as a treatment.
Sentence	63	Recognising the link to physical ailments, he told an interviewer "The brain does not exist in isolation, and we need to understand that pathways similar to those that underpin risks for cardiovascular disorders, stroke, and osteoporosis might also underpin the risk for psychiatric disorders, and that other treatments might be helpful."
Sentence	64	Berk also touched upon speed of diagnosis and treatment; "Early interventions can potentially improve the outcome" of bipolar sufferers, he told his audience.
Sentence	65	MDF The Bipolar Organisation claim an average of ten years is possible before a person is diagnosed.
Sentence	66	“This clearly is an issue,  if we believe that earlier diagnosis and treatment facilitate better outcomes,” Berk told Wikinews.
Sentence	67	Though he questions the effectiveness of currently-used drugs on advanced bipolar cases, he does not go so far as to say drugs are actively harmful.
Sentence	68	He told us “it appears that our best treatments work best earlier in the illness course; and that seems to apply to psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy.”
Sentence	69	Berk has already performed research using statins which suggests they can form a treatment.
Sentence	70	He now seeks funding for research involving aspirin.
Sentence	71	On funding, he tells Wikinews “psychiatric disorders comprise between 16% and 22% of the burden of disability (depending on who measures it), attracts[sic] just over 6% of the clinical budget at least in Australia and 3% of the research budget.
Sentence	72	Research as a discretionary spending item is at great risk.”
Sentence	73	Berk’s research, in the past, has been funded by companies including GlaxoSmithKline.
Sentence	74	Hudson told Wikinews this did not concern her charity; in fact, they welcomed it.
Sentence	75	“We believe it is important pharmaceutical companies continue to invest in the development of new medications for bipolar.
Sentence	76	This is how it works in all other health specialities and mental health should be no different.”
Sentence	77	“There is a need for greater education for mental health professionals and GPs [general practitioners] about bipolar [in the UK],” she told us.
Sentence	78	“As the national bipolar charity we receive many, many calls and requests from GPs and other health professionals for our leaflets and information sheets which is fantastic.
Sentence	79	We very much welcome opportunities to work together for the benefit of individuals affected by bipolar.”
Sentence	80	Wikinews contacted the UK’s National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) to discuss issues raised in this article, including future treatments, genetic screening, and mortality rates.
Sentence	81	NICE did not respond.
Sentence	82	Might statins and/or aspirin improve treatment – might they be cheaper, perhaps, or safer?
Sentence	83	“This is an area of research promise,” says Berk, “however it is too early to make any clinical treatment claims; [all] we can say is that this needs to be studied in properly designed trials capable of giving a more definitive answer.” And what of possible explanations for the increased mortality rate observed in England?
Sentence	84	Should researchers look at whether bipolar influences more than just the brain, or if it is linked to other genetic conditions?
Sentence	85	“For sure,” he told us.
Sentence	86	“There is new evidence that similar pathways contribute to the risk for both medical and psychiatric illness, both in terms of lifestyle factors, and biomarkers of risk.”

Sentence	1	 NORWAY; Kristiansand: In the weekend between the 11. and 13. of March the Norwegian Centre Party held its annual National Conference in Kristiansand.
Sentence	2	The conference was clearly inspired by the prospects of a majority in the parliament together with the Norwegian Socialist Left- and Labour Party, according to all polls.
Sentence	3	In this conference the leader, Åslaug Haga, was re-elected against one vote and to great applaus from the 187 other voters.
Sentence	4	Compromise on oil drilling in the Barents Sea The matter of greatest anticipation before the convention was a question if the environmentalist Centre Party would open for oil drilling in the Barents Sea.
Sentence	5	The Centre Youth had clearly announced its opposition to the suggestion at an earlier point.
Sentence	6	After a long debate with both very young and very old committed debaters the coalition of the hardest environmentalists, the leader and the Centre Youth surprisingly lost the voting.
Sentence	7	The Centre Party opened for a compromise proposed by one of the two second leaders, Lars Peder Brekk, on accepting oil drilling with untraditionally strong demands for environmental safety.
Sentence	8	Focus on decentralization The leader, Åslaug Haga, and most of the debaters in the conference made it clear that the Centre Party was sharpening it decentralization-knives.
Sentence	9	In the conference Haga was joined by several other active members in underlining the Centre Partys role as the most dedicated decentralizationing-party in Norway.
Sentence	10	It was clear from the debaters that the main role of the party in a possibly upcoming majority-government (majority in parliament) with the Labour and Socialist Left Party mainly was to make the government focus on turning around the sentralization of Norway and to hinder the Labour Party and the Conservative Party from cooperating on sending a new application for membership in the European Union.

Sentence	9	It is illegal to make or use counterfeited coins, according to the Royal Mint, who said that all people who believe they are in possession of a fake must hand it in.
Sentence	10	In comparison, the Euro has been estimated as having less than 0.1% counterfeit coins among the circulation of 50c, €1 and €2 coins.

Sentence	1	If recent trends are to portend the future, late Roman Catholic pontiff John Paul II may be known to posterity as "John Paul the Great."
Sentence	2	A growing portion of Catholics, and even senior clergy, have begun to use the title, which has been held previously by only three out of history's 264 popes.
Sentence	3	Pope Gregory I of the sixth century, Leo I of the fifth century, and Nicholas I of the ninth century up to now, have alone been acclaimed "Great" in church tradition.
Sentence	4	Cardinal Egan of New York, Cardinal O'Brien of Edinburgh (Scotland), Dublin's Archbishop Martin, and Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor of Westminster — the highest Catholic clergyman in England and Wales — have been among those reported to have used the honorific for John Paul II.
Sentence	5	Historian Robert Louis Wilken, writing in Catholic periodical Commonweal in 2003, "Greatness is as mysterious as it is elusive," alluding to the ambiguity of the criteria used in applying the title.

Sentence	7	X."

Sentence	17	Emails can also be sent to id@missingpersons.org.
Sentence	18	According to the man's social worker, Michael Camp, all initial leads (including the Swedish flag information) have gone cold.
Sentence	19	One notable lead on May 17 came from a Polish man called Darius Dydymski who claimed that the man is a French street musician he worked with in Nice named Steven Villa Masson(e).
Sentence	20	However, this lead turned up cold on May 18 when Masson's sister, Julie Villa Massone said, "I saw my brother yesterday in Nice."
Sentence	21	Also, AFP found him living in Nice near the train station.
Sentence	22	A Wikinews contributor believes that the person referenced is an acquaintance of his named Geoffrey Betts.
Sentence	23	Betts is an actor who is a citizen of the U.K.  Betts has lived much of his life in the Dallas, Texas area and has spent some time recently in Louisville, Kentucky.
Sentence	24	A visual comparison of the person in the various news articles can be compared to Geoff's website (listed in External links below).

Sentence	3	Atlanta, Georgia —After losing their bid to host Wikimania 2008, Wikimedians from the Atlanta, Georgia bid proposal are now working to host a conference focusing on Wikimedia in the Americas.
Sentence	4	Mike Halterman, a student at the University of South Florida and unpaid intern at the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) offices in St. Petersburg, Florida, is helping to plan the Conference of the Americas which will be held at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) in Atlanta, Georgia on May 15-18, 2008.
Sentence	5	Several others who helped in the conference's creation include: Andrew Guyton, Dan Rosenthal, Geoff Swanstrom, Hillary Lipko, Jessica Gibson, Matt Britt, and Wikinews administrator and contributor Craig Spurrier.
Sentence	6	"We went forward after Wikimania because we felt that we had a good idea on our hands, and all the organization and manpower should not go to waste.
Sentence	7	We can still make a difference here in our own hemisphere, which as far as Wikimedia goes, has been overlooked in favor of the world picture.
Sentence	8	We want to show the work done by people here, and how it impacts people here," said Halterman in an exclusive interview with Wikinews.
Sentence	9	The conference is focused on "discussions of Wikimedia and the free culture movement and how they relate to communities (national/regional, social, linguistic); discussions about the impacts free culture movements have in these communities, and by the work done in said movements in everyday life," says the announcement.
Sentence	10	The discussion includes North America, specifically the United States and Canada, along with the countries of Latin America.
Sentence	11	Wikimedia Argentina and the WMF have also been given a proposal, but decisions on endorsement are still pending for both.
Sentence	12	There will also be a journalism segment that will be held inside the Turner Broadcasting building on Techwood Drive in Midtown Atlanta.
Sentence	13	After the location of Wikimania 2008 was announced to be in Alexandria, Egypt, the LGBT community spoke out, wondering if the jury, a group of Wikimedians who selected the location, took into account LGBT rights, safety of all attending, human rights, or free speech in the country before making their decision.
Sentence	14	There has since been discussion and controversy over the location posted on several public mailing lists.
Sentence	15	Despite that, Halterman, who was on the bidding team to have Wikimania 2008 in Atlanta, states that the Conference of the Americas was not formed in retaliation, revenge or to "out maneuver" Wikimania 2008 and that the discussion for the COTA was taking place long before the location of Wikimania was announced.
Sentence	16	He also states that the conference's purpose is not to compete with it, but to give those who are in the western hemisphere a chance to attend a Wikimedia event for the Americas.
Sentence	17	"This was never something that was supposed to be 'the American solution.'
Sentence	18	We aren't trying to compete with Wikimania at all.
Sentence	19	We're not out to make a statement against Wikimania.
Sentence	20	This isn't done out of anger, it's done out of a drive to unite, not to divide.
Sentence	21	We have over 100 interested parties all over the United States who want to volunteer and/or attend in some fashion or another.
Sentence	22	Reaching out to the other communities is high on our list of priorities and we really do want to make this a hemispheric effort" as "it's more expensive for people to go to Egypt over something in their own country or something close enough to it," said Halterman to Wikinews.
Sentence	23	The conference is sponsored by Georgia Tech, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the Public Journalism Network (pjnet), Ibiblio.org and the Carolina Open Source Initiative.

Sentence	7	Tim Ralph said, after Haggard completed a three-week counseling program, "He [Haggard] is completely heterosexual."
Sentence	8	However, Mike Jones, the man who had allegedly had a 3 year relationship with Haggard publicly replied, "Give me a break."
Sentence	9	Adding, "He’s been performing oral sex on me for three years.
Sentence	10	You don’t change that in three weeks."
Sentence	11	And "Until he’s honest with himself, he’ll never be happy."
Sentence	12	Jones is currently writing a book detailing his relationship with Haggard due out in summer 2007.
Sentence	13	According to interim senior pastor Ross Parsley, at services on Sunday February 18 the panel will "provide any necessary clarification of (Haggard's) restoration process and give us a report on the New Life staff."

Article	194
Sentence	1	With the United States in a recession, more and more people are looking for ways to spend less money and get a better bargain at the same time.
Sentence	2	In a time where prices are higher, 'recession gardens' are becoming increasingly popular, echoing the victory gardens which were planted during World War I and World War II which helped to reduce the stress and pressure of food shortages.
Sentence	3	"There is more interest in vegetable gardens similar to the victory gardens.
Sentence	4	Because of the economy, they are being called recession gardens," said a master gardener who volunteers at Ohio State University's Extension Service office, Fred Hanacek.
Sentence	5	The new fad recently caught on in Iowa where families have began to plant the recession gardens to save money in the produce sections of supermarkets, especially organic fruits and vegetables.
Sentence	6	Public News Service quotes the National Gardening Association (NGA) as saying that they expect a nearly 20% increase in personal home garden across the U.S..
Sentence	7	Some of the increase is also due to people wanting to know what goes onto their vegetables and in their foods.
Sentence	8	"I do believe you'll find there's an extra expense in actually producing your own food, but the food quality you get is far better than what you can purchase in a store," said Beverly Bernhard a veteran gardener from Iowa.
Sentence	9	The new trend has also gotten the attention of U.S. president Barack Obama who recently stated that he plans to plant a vegetable garden at the White House.
Sentence	10	It will be the first vegetable garden to be planted at the White House in over 20 years.
Sentence	11	The last time a garden of this kind was planted at the White House was in World War II when Eleanor Roosevelt planted her Victory Garden.
Sentence	12	In 1800, former U.S. president John Adams is reported to have planted the first White House garden.
Sentence	13	Andrew Jackson went a bit further, building a greenhouse.
Sentence	14	Michelle Obama, the First Lady of the United States, broke ground on the new garden with the fifth grade class at Bancroft Elementary located in Washington, D.C. on March 20.
Sentence	15	The garden, which will be 1,100 square feet and an 'L' shape, will be located on the White House's South Lawn and the Obamas plan to grow over 55 varieties of vegetables.
Sentence	16	"Let’s hear it for vegetables.
Sentence	17	Let’s hear it for fruits," yelled Mrs. Obama as they broke ground on the garden.
Sentence	18	"I’ve been able to have my kids eat so many different things that they would have never touched if we had bought them at a store," she added.
Sentence	19	Mrs. Obama also said that it will be the entire family's responsibility to maintain the garden, including the U.S. president.
Sentence	20	Many vegetables grow easily, without having to do a lot of work to maintain them.
Sentence	21	Some examples are lettuce and zucchini.
Sentence	22	The NGA says at least 9 million Americans will grow vegetable gardens for the first time ever in 2009.
Sentence	23	An estimated 43 million Americans will plant their own personal vegetable gardens this year.

Article	107
Sentence	1	An investigation performed by the scientific review, Nature, on Wikipedia and Britannica science entries, found that the two encyclopedias have similar degrees of accuracy in their content.
Sentence	2	Nature used peer reviewing to compare Wikipedia and Britannica's coverage of science.
Sentence	3	In this study, entries were chosen from the websites of Wikipedia and Encyclopaedia Britannica on a broad range of scientific disciplines and sent to a relevant expert for peer review.
Sentence	4	Each reviewer examined the entry on a single subject from the two encyclopedias without being told which article came from which encyclopaedia.
Sentence	5	The reviewers were asked to check for errors, but were not told where the information came from.
Sentence	6	Among 42 entries tested, the difference in accuracy was not significant: the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica, about three.
Sentence	7	In the pairs of articles reviewed, eight serious errors such as misinterpretations of important concepts were detected, four from each encyclopaedia.
Sentence	8	Reviewers also found many factual errors, omissions or misleading statements: 162 in Wikipedia and 123 in Britannica.
Sentence	9	Additionally, it was found that Wikipedia articles are 2.6 times as long as Britannica articles, meaning that there is a lower error/ommision per word ratio in Wikipedia.
Sentence	10	The main criticism about Wikipedia was on its readability, with several reviewers commenting that the articles they read were poorly structured and confusing.
Sentence	11	As well as comparing the two encyclopedias, Nature surveyed more than 1,000 Nature authors and found that although more than 70% had heard of Wikipedia and 17% of those consulted it on a weekly basis, less than 10% help to update it.
Sentence	12	Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales welcomed the study.
Sentence	13	"We're hoping it will focus people's attention on the overall level of our work, which is pretty good," he told BBC News.

Article	51
Sentence	1	Former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was the target of a bombing which killed at least 136 people Thursday night, hours after landing at Karachi Airport.
Sentence	2	Bhutto's arrival in the country with more than 100 supporters, breaking eight years of self-imposed exile, was met by more than 20,000 police and military troops.
Sentence	3	Security was tight, after a warning that militants could attempt to assassinate the former leader.
Sentence	4	Bhutto is disliked by many traditionalist Pakistanis who consider her rule to have brought the country too close to the United States.
Sentence	5	Bhutto had told reporters she was "not scared" and was concentrating on her mission, only hours before the attack.
Sentence	6	Bhutto, who was traveling from the airport to a rally atop an armoured truck, was unharmed and taken back to her ancestral home of Bilawal House by police and security forces.
Sentence	7	At least 20 police were killed in the bombing.
Sentence	8	Sources indicate there may have been multiple explosions, with a smaller blast preceding the main one, in what CNN's Dan Rivers described as a "large-scale attack".
Sentence	9	Two other men were taken into custody following the attacks, one carrying a belt of explosives and another carrying a pistol.
Sentence	10	Pakistani Minister of Information Tariq Azim Khan has stated that the attack, which injured another 150 people, was believed to be a suicide bombing.
Sentence	11	Manzur Mughal, a Karachi police officer, reported that a skull believed to belong to one of the bombers had been found, and taken to a forensics lab.
Sentence	12	Bhutto was in the country, having been waived of any corruption charges by President Pervez Musharraf last week, to discuss the possibility of a joint government dedicated to fighting extremism in the volatile country.
Sentence	13	Bhutto had told reporters that she did not want the country associated with the training of terrorists.

Article	347
Sentence	1	A script prepared by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the Government of the United Kingdom in the 1970s, and released today, shows the text of the radio announcement that would be made in case of a nuclear attack on Britain.
Sentence	2	The script was released by The National Archives, and it was discussed during the years from 1973 to 1975, as an act of preparation for a nuclear attack.
Sentence	3	This increased concern occurred due to the ongoing Cold War.
Sentence	4	The script started by saying "This is the Wartime Broadcasting Service.
Sentence	5	This country has been attacked with nuclear weapons.
Sentence	6	Communications have been severely disrupted, and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known.
Sentence	7	We shall bring you further information as soon as possible.
Sentence	8	Meanwhile, stay tuned to this wavelength, stay calm and stay in your own homes."
Sentence	9	It emphasised people should not leave their homes: "Remember there is nothing to be gained by trying to get away.
Sentence	10	By leaving your homes you could be exposing yourselves to greater danger."
Sentence	11	"If you leave, you may find yourself without food, without water, without accommodation and without protection.
Sentence	12	Radioactive fall-out, which follows a nuclear explosion, is many times more dangerous if you are directly exposed to it in the open.
Sentence	13	Roofs and walls offer substantial protection.
Sentence	14	The safest place is indoors."
Sentence	15	The script continued by telling citizens to "make sure gas and other fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished," before telling the listener to "use your water only for essential drinking and cooking purposes."
Sentence	16	"Make your food stocks last: ration your supply, because it may have to last for 14 days or more," continued the script.
Sentence	17	"If you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given, stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out."
Sentence	18	The script finishes people by telling people to turn off their radio to conserve energy.
Sentence	19	The documents were released under Britain's Freedom of Information Act, and it also said that all reports should be given out in an authoritative and comforting tone.
Sentence	20	It also contains letters from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications which describe how the use of a familiar voice will assure listeners that the BBC has not been obliterated.

Article	291
Sentence	1	Approximately 13,000 people in the British city of  Bristol participated in either the Race for Life or the Run for Moore this weekend as part of one of the largest running events in the south west of England.
Sentence	2	The first of the day, the woman only Race for Life, started at 11:00 local time (10:00 UTC.
Sentence	3	This continues on from yesterday, where other woman competed in the Race for Life.
Sentence	4	The quickest finishing time for the event was around 20 minutes for the five kilometer race, with the slowest time being over an hour.
Sentence	5	Later in the day, at approximately 14:00 local time, the warm up for the mens event started.
Sentence	6	It was lead by people on the temporary stage (pictured).
Sentence	7	At 14:30, the mens event started.
Sentence	8	The finishing times for this event varied from about 20 minutes to approximately 50 minutes.
Sentence	9	Before the warm up participants were shown a video showing the effects of cancer.
Sentence	10	The run is in aid of Cancer Research UK.

Article	219
Sentence	1	The website WikiLeaks.org has been taken off line in many parts of the world.
Sentence	2	Wikileaks is a website dedicated to leaking documents that are "anonymous, untraceable, uncensorable."
Sentence	3	Several factors have taken the site off line including DDoS attacks, which was followed by a fire which took out the main servers hosting the site in Sweden, and a restraining order on the domain name 'WikiLeaks.org' issued in the United States.
Sentence	4	According to the website HongPong.com, Wikileaks experienced "a 500Mbps distributed denial of service attack" before the fire, but it is not known if the DDoS attack is connected to it.
Sentence	5	After the attack, a fire was reported in the Uninterruptible Power Supply of the servers which host the site.
Sentence	6	The third and final factor taking the site off line is a permanent injunction granted in the California Northern District Court in San Francisco, California to Bank Julius Baer, a Swiss Bank, which has caused the domain to be taken off line in the U.S.. Wikileaks previously published hundreds of documents obtained from a whistleblower of the Swiss Bank, "purportedly showing offshore tax evasion and money laundering by extremely wealthy and in some cases, politically sensitive, clients from the US, Europe, China and Peru."
Sentence	7	According to a Wikileaks press release received by e-mail, the injunction issued by the court states, "Dynadot [Wikileaks host] shall immediately clear and remove all DNS hosting records for the wikileaks.org domain name and prevent the domain name from resolving to the wikileaks.org website or any other website or server other than a blank park page, until further order of this Court."
Sentence	8	"The order was entirely written by Cayman Island's Bank Julius Baer lawyers and was accepted by judge White without amendment, or representations by Wikileaks or amicus.
Sentence	9	The case is over several Wikileaks articles, public commentary and documents dating prior to 2003.
Sentence	10	The documents allegedly reveal secret Julius Baer trust structures used for asset hiding, money laundering and tax evasion.
Sentence	11	The bank alleges the documents were disclosed to Wikileaks by offshore banking whistleblower and former Vice President of the Cayman Island's operation, Rudolf Elmer.
Sentence	12	Unable to lawfully attack Wikileaks servers which are based in several countries, the order was served on Wikileaks's California registrar Dynadot ("the power company").
Sentence	13	The order also enjoins every person who has heard about the order from even linking to the documents," said Wikileaks in the release.
Sentence	14	Despite the injunction, Wikileaks states that they will "keep on publishing, in-fact, given the level of suppression involved in this case, Wikileaks will step up publication of documents pertaining to illegal or unethical banking practices."
Sentence	15	Despite the injunction, the site can still be accessed at http://88.80.13.160/wiki/Wikileaks.

Article	9
Sentence	1	MP3s for the people?
Sentence	2	The Pirate Party, a new Swedish political party first publicized in January, wants to legalize sharing music, movies, and other copyrighted content using the Internet.
Sentence	3	What may seem like a doomed effort by a small group of idealists is attracting significant media attention, in part due to a recent police raid on The Pirate Bay, an extremely popular BitTorrent tracker (see Wikinews coverage).
Sentence	4	The Pirate Bay allows people to download content listed in its database using the BitTorrent protocol (including the latest Hollywood movies or computer games) and has gained something of an international cult status, in part for its public and irreverent responses to legal threats received from copyright lawyers of major corporations.
Sentence	5	The site was reopened days after the raid on Dutch servers (but is now back in Sweden again).
Sentence	6	Rickard Falkvinge, leader of the Pirate Party, argues that regardless of the legal outcome in the case, the web site demonstrates that copyright law in its current form is not sustainable.
Sentence	7	Adopting the moniker of the maligned "Internet pirates", the party argues for drastically limiting the scope and enforcement of copyright law, abolishing patent law, and protecting privacy in what it sees as a "control and surveillance society".
Sentence	8	The party is hoping to garner enough votes in the September election to become a small but important faction in the next Swedish parliament.
Sentence	9	Rickard Falkvinge found some time in between interviews and party work to answer our questions.
Sentence	10	There are rumours that the Swedish government was indirectly acting on behalf of the U.S. MPAA in shutting down the site.
Sentence	11	Do you feel that your government is beholden to U.S. interests?
Sentence	12	Oh, the MPAA said so themselves in a press release, it's more than a rumor.
Sentence	13	Check their press release "Swedish authorities sink Pirate Bay".
Sentence	14	[Ed.
Sentence	15	: see below]
Sentence	16	And yes, this particular fact has caused something of an uproar in Sweden.
Sentence	17	It's widely believed that Swedish authorities were more or less ordered by a foreign power to act forcefully against an entity that was in, at worst, a legal gray area according to Swedish law.
Sentence	18	The raid must have boosted your recognition.
Sentence	19	How many members do you currently have, and how successful has your fundraising effort been so far?
Sentence	20	Our member count is at 6540, no, 6541, no wait, 6543... well, you get the picture.
Sentence	21	Our members register themselves on our website after paying the membership fee electronically, which helps reduce our admin load considerably.
Sentence	22	Fundraising brought in 108,000 SEK [Ed.
Sentence	23	: approx.
Sentence	24	14,700 USD or 11,600 EUR], enough to buy 3 million ballots, which is some kind of at-least-we're-not-starving minimum.
Sentence	25	We're not full, but we're not starving, either.
Sentence	26	Following the raid on the Pirate Bay, we have received another 50K in donations.
Sentence	27	My sincere thanks to everybody who wants to help out; we are now looking into getting more ballots to make sure we don't run out on election day.
Sentence	28	(10 million ballots was our initial full-score aim.)
Sentence	29	Do you think you will be able to cover future expenses such as radio and television ads?
Sentence	30	Following the raid on the Pirate Bay, and our tripling of the member roster, we don't need advertising.
Sentence	31	We've been mentioned almost every news hour across all channels on national television in the last week.
Sentence	32	Also, the established parties have now started to turn, following our success.
Sentence	33	Parties representing almost half of the elected parliament are now describing today's copyright situation as not working.
Sentence	34	They still don't understand why, though, they are just echoing what we say without understanding what the words mean.
Sentence	35	We'll get around to teaching them — them and the voters alike.
Sentence	36	This might be hard for people not following the Swedish media to grasp, but we have made a big splash.
Sentence	37	Today, our Minister of Justice was quoted as saying that he's open to changes to copyright laws that would make file-sharing legal, with the headline "Bodström (his name) flip-flops about file sharing."
Sentence	38	Immediately underneath were the Pirate Party's comments to his suggestions.
Sentence	39	Let's take that again: when a minister makes a statement about file sharing, media calls us for comments, and publishes them next to that statement.
Sentence	40	That's how big we have become since the raid on the Pirate Bay.
Sentence	41	The Minister of Justice later denied having made that statement to the press that reported it.
Sentence	42	We will never be able to pay for television ads, the way I see it.
Sentence	43	Unless a very wealthy donor comes on stage.
Sentence	44	(If any such person is reading this, we have planned how to spend up to $375,000 in a cost-efficient way up until the elections, on the chance that donations appear.
Sentence	45	That spending does still not include any TV ads.)
Sentence	46	Are you aware of similar initiatives in other countries?
Sentence	47	Some are trying, but none have achieved the necessary momentum and critical mass that we have.
Sentence	48	We expect that momentum to happen once we get into Swedish Parliament and show that it can be done.
Sentence	49	[Ed.
Sentence	50	: A United States variant of the party was recently launched.
Sentence	51	See also: Intellectual property activism category on Wikipedia]
Sentence	52	The name "Pirate Party" seems to identify the party with what is currently defined as a crime: piracy of software, movies, music, and so on.
Sentence	53	Will a name like "Pirate Party" not antagonize voters, given that the label is so negatively used?
Sentence	54	How about potential allies abroad who argue for a more balanced copyright regime, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation or Creative Commons?
Sentence	55	Oh, it is a crime.
Sentence	56	That's the heart of the problem!
Sentence	57	The very problem is that something that 20% of the voters are doing is illegal by punishment of jail time.
Sentence	58	That's what we want to change.
Sentence	59	Where the established parties are saying that the voters are broken, we are saying it's the law that is broken.
Sentence	60	Besides, it's a way of reclaiming a word.
Sentence	61	The media conglomerates have been pointing at us and calling us pirates, trying to make us somehow feel shame.
Sentence	62	It doesn't work.
Sentence	63	We wear clothes saying "PIRATE" in bright colors out on the streets.
Sentence	64	Yes, we are pirates, and we're proud of it, too.
Sentence	65	Also, the term is not that negative at all in Sweden, much thanks to the awesome footwork of the Pirate Bureau (Piratbyrån), who have been working since 2003 to educate the public.
Sentence	66	If you are elected, and have the opportunity to become part of the next government of Sweden, do you intend to focus only on the issues in your platform (IP law and privacy)?
Sentence	67	Our current plan is to support the government from the parliament, but not be part of it.
Sentence	68	If we're part of it, that means we get a vested interest to not overthrow it, which puts us in a weaker position if they start going against our interests.
Sentence	69	Overall, our strategy is to achieve the balance of power, where both the left and right blocks need our votes to achieve a majority, and then support the issues of whichever government that agrees to drive our issues the strongest.
Sentence	70	Basically, we sell our votes on other issues to the highest bidder in exchange for them driving ours.
Sentence	71	Have you already made any contacts in Swedish politics?
Sentence	72	Contacts...
Sentence	73	I'm not sure what you mean.
Sentence	74	Several of us have been shaking hands with some of the established politicians, particularly in the youth leagues, if that's what you mean.
Sentence	75	I was thinking along the lines of exploring possible modes of cooperation with established political parties — are you already taken seriously?
Sentence	76	We are taken seriously by most of the youth leagues and by at least one of the represented parties.
Sentence	77	In particular, which is what counts, we are now taken seriously by national media.
Sentence	78	However, we can't tie contacts that explore modes of cooperation quite yet — since our strategy depends on holding the balance of power, we need to not express a preference for whom we'd like to cooperate with, or we'd put ourselves in a weaker bargaining position.
Sentence	79	What is your position on moral rights, as recognized by European Union copyright laws: the right of attribution, the right to have a work published anonymously or pseudonymously, and the right to the integrity of the work.
Sentence	80	Do you think these rights should be preserved?
Sentence	81	We safeguard the right to attribution very strongly.
Sentence	82	After all, what we are fighting for is the intent of copyright as it is described in the US constitution: the promotion of culture.
Sentence	83	Many artists are using recognition as their primary driving force to create culture.
Sentence	84	Publishing anonymously or pseudonymously happens every day on the Internet, so no big deal there either.
Sentence	85	The right to integrity, however, is an interesting issue.
Sentence	86	We state that we are for free sampling, meaning you can take a sound that I made for my tune and use it in your own tunes, or for that matter, a whole phrase.
Sentence	87	That's partially in line with today's copyright law on derivative works; as long as you add your own creative touch to a work, you get your own protection for the derivation.
Sentence	88	We want to strengthen that right.
Sentence	89	You might want to consider the alternative.
Sentence	90	In the 50s and 60s, a lot of rock and roll bands started doing covers of old classical music.
Sentence	91	This would almost certainly have been considered to violate the integrity of the original artist — and was considered to do so by many — but in the eyes of many others, it was instead great new culture of a previously unseen form and shape.
Sentence	92	So I don't have a definite answer on the integrity issue.
Sentence	93	While I am leaning towards the promotion of new culture taking precedence over a limitation right, there may be unconsidered cases.
Sentence	94	Do you feel that trademark law is adequate as it is?
Sentence	95	Yes.
Sentence	96	We have not seen any hidden costs to trademarks that outweigh the benefits of reducing transaction costs on a market where seller and buyer are not personally acquainted.
Sentence	97	How do you intend to deal with EU treaties which define certain legal frameworks for the protection of intellectual works?
Sentence	98	What can they do?
Sentence	99	Fine us?
Sentence	100	Send us an angry letter?
Sentence	101	Come on, countries need to think more like corporations.
Sentence	102	If the fine is less than the cost to society, which it is in this case, then the right thing to do is to accept the fine with a polite "thank you".
Sentence	103	Actually, national media just called me about this very question; the Department of Justice has stated that we can't allow file sharing, as it would break international treaties.
Sentence	104	My response was that it is more important to not have 1.2 million Swedes criminalized, than it is to avoid paying a penalty fee.
Sentence	105	Do you think that weaker intellectual property laws would lessen the amount of products released in Sweden by foreign companies, such as Hollywood studios?
Sentence	106	As long as they believe that they will have a revenue here that exceeds the cost of operations, they will keep coming here.
Sentence	107	Anything else would be wrong from a corporate standpoint.
Sentence	108	Besides, you need to remember what we are doing is to change the map according to what reality looks like.
Sentence	109	We do not want to change people's behavior.
Sentence	110	We want to change the law so it reflects what the world actually looks like.
Sentence	111	So, as they apparently make a profit today, I expect that to continue.
Sentence	112	Do you feel that the music industry in its current form will still be needed in a world where non-commercial copying is permitted?
Sentence	113	It's not so much if they are needed where non-commercial copying is permitted, rather if they are needed when they're not necessary any more to be the middle man between consumer and artist.
Sentence	114	The music industry will lose its current chokepoint, because they don't add any value to the end product any longer.
Sentence	115	They will probably survive as a service bureau for artists, but they will not be able to control distribution.
Sentence	116	It's actually quite simple: if they get their act together and provide a service that people want to buy, they will remain.
Sentence	117	If not, they will vanish.
Sentence	118	Today, they have legislated that people must buy their service regardless of whether it adds value or not, and that's not gonna hold in the long term.
Sentence	119	Why fight against intellectual property laws, instead of focusing your energy on creating freely licensed content, such as Creative Commons films or open source software?
Sentence	120	I want to raise the issue a level, to show that it's not about payment models or what level of control the copyright holder chooses to exert over his or her work.
Sentence	121	Let me put it this way: we have achieved the technical possibility of sending copyrighted works in digital, private communications.
Sentence	122	I can send a piece of music in e-mail to you, I can drop a video clip in a chat room.
Sentence	123	That technology is not going away, leaving us with two choices.
Sentence	124	So — if copyright is to be enforced — if you are to tax, prohibit, fee, fine, or otherwise hinder the transmission of copyrighted works in private communications, the only way to achieve that is to have all private communications constantly monitored.
Sentence	125	It's really that large.
Sentence	126	Also, this is partly nothing new.
Sentence	127	We've been able to do this since the advent of the Xerox copier — you could photocopy a poem or a painting and put it in a letter in the mail.
Sentence	128	Again, the only way to discover or stop that would have been for the authorities to open all letters and check their content.
Sentence	129	So we're at a crossroads here.
Sentence	130	Either we, as a society, decide that copyright is the greater value to society, and take active steps to give up private communications as a concept.
Sentence	131	Either that, or we decide that the ability to communicate in private, without constant monitoring by authorities, has the greater value — in which case copyright will have to give way.
Sentence	132	My choice is clear.
Sentence	133	The Pirate Bay was shut down and re-opened days later on a Dutch server.
Sentence	134	According to a Swedish newspaper report, traffic has doubled since then.
Sentence	135	How long do you think the cat and mouse game will continue?
Sentence	136	Until one of two things happen: The authorities realize they can't enforce laws that require monitoring all private communications, especially given the large international level of grassroots support, or [they] actually start monitoring all private communications.

Sentence	1	A "very dangerous" inmate whose convictions include rape and murder has escaped from Tembisa Hospital in South Africa.
Sentence	2	29-year-old Andries Gamba Msimang, from Mozambique, absconded on Friday.
Sentence	3	—Department of Corrections
Sentence	4	Jailed in September 2009, Msimang "is serving a life sentence for murder, robbery, rape and house breaking with intent to rob and kidnap," says the Department of Correctional Services.
Sentence	5	The Department urges the public to summon police help if they see the escapee and not attempt to apprehend him themselves.
Sentence	6	The Department further explained the man has been in hospital since Tuesday when he suffered a stroke.
Sentence	7	Two corrections officers left to guard the prisoner in hospital have been suspended and their employer says they "may face charges of gross negligence and dereliction of responsibility."
Sentence	8	Police and the Department of Corrections are working together to try and return the killer to custody.

Sentence	1	Sporting Braga of Portugal held Bayern Munich to a 1-1 draw today.
Sentence	2	The draw along with Bolton's draw with Aris keeps Bayern at the top of Group F.
Sentence	3	Uli Hoeneß: “As we’ve already seen against Belenenses, you have to be prepared for an unbelievably hard physical encounter when you come to Portugal.
Sentence	4	We were the victims of a few bad fouls, but the referee let a little bit too much go for my taste.
Sentence	5	It’s important we go on and win the group, because our first match would be away to one of the third-placed teams, and that’s a huge advantage.
Sentence	6	But we still hold all the trump cards.
Sentence	7	If we beat Aris Salonika at home, we definitely finish top.“
Sentence	8	Ottmar Hitzfeld: “We came here to win today, and we went out and controlled the play accordingly.
Sentence	9	Braga had a couple of decent chances before half-time, but otherwise we had much more possession.
Sentence	10	I felt we lacked the absolute will to win, however.
Sentence	11	We should have tackled more aggressively in the first half, and we never found a way through up front.
Sentence	12	We were in the driving seat at 1-0 up, then Demichelis slipped and we conceded the equaliser.
Sentence	13	We can’t be entirely satisfied, because we came here intending to win.“
Sentence	14	Miroslav Klose: “We never really got going today.
Sentence	15	We were basically in control, but we didn’t dominate enough to create many chances.
Sentence	16	We’re at home in our last game, and that’s a must-win match.“
Sentence	17	Mark van Bommel: “You can’t be happy with the draw after taking the lead here.
Sentence	18	We were totally in control and scored straight after half-time.
Sentence	19	In normal circumstances we’d have gone on and taken the points, but Braga aren’t a bad side.
Sentence	20	People think we’ll win all our matches, but it’s just not as simple as that.“
Sentence	21	Roland Linz (Braga goalscorer): “Scoring against Bayern is always special.
Sentence	22	The draw was very, very important for us.
Sentence	23	It was pretty evenly-matched over the 90 minutes, although we had one or two very good chances.
Sentence	24	I reckon the draw was the right result.
Sentence	25	It rates as a success for us, but it was definitely less than Bayern were hoping for.“

Sentence	1	An "aggressive"  strain of Avian Flu has been detected in two tufted ducks in Oskarshamn, Southeast Sweden.
Sentence	2	This makes Sweden the ninth country in the EU to confirm Avian Flu on their soil.
Sentence	3	Some 35–40 wild birds were found dead.
Sentence	4	The birds were brought to Uppsala, where an analysis confirmed the presence of an "aggressive" form of Avian Flu.
Sentence	5	Tests at a laboratory in the UK will later eventually confirm whether the birds died of the lethal H5N1.
Sentence	6	Sweden's Minister of Agriculture, Ann-Christin Nykvist, said at a press conference the discovery was "serious but not unexpected."
Sentence	7	Sweden has been on high alert since the virus was found on the German island Rügen in the Baltic Sea.
Sentence	8	Two security zones are being established around the location where the birds were found.
Sentence	9	Dead birds will be destroyed and domestic stocks in the affected area will be monitored.

Sentence	1	Football fans in Spain were rejoicing on Friday after an octopus called Paul predicted their team will win the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
Sentence	2	Paul the Octopus, who lives in an aquarium in Oberhausen, in western Germany, has so far correctly forecast who will win every World Cup game involving the German side.
Sentence	3	Paul also predicted that the German team will beat Uruguay in Saturday's match for third place.
Sentence	4	The octopus has become something of a celebrity during the World Cup, as all six of his predictions for Germany's World Cup games proved accurate.
Sentence	5	His final prediction, for Sunday's final between Spain and the Netherlands, was broadcast live on television.
Sentence	6	The eight-legged sea creature was given two boxes to choose from — one marked with a flag from the Netherlands and another with the flag of Spain.
Sentence	7	In the end it was the Spanish flag he went for.
Sentence	8	Rupert Adams of William Hill, one of Britain's largest bookmakers, said that the octopus's success rate is remarkable.
Sentence	9	"If you had had ten pounds on each and every prediction then re-invested your winnings you would currently have over 1,450 pounds," said Adams.
Sentence	10	"It's an astonishing feat to get six predictions in a row.
Sentence	11	I am told people are walking into our shops and saying 'I will have what the Octopus predicted.'"
Sentence	12	But David Spiegelhalter, Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk at the University of Cambridge, was less convinced of the animal's abilities, pointing out that many other creatures failed to predict the correct outcomes of matches and went unreported.
Sentence	13	"It's like seeing footage of a golfer getting a hole-in-one," Spiegelhalter said.
Sentence	14	"We're not seeing the millions of times the golfer made the shot and it didn't go in."
Sentence	15	At least one other animal has weighed in on the World Cup final.
Sentence	16	Mani, a 13 year old parakeet from Singapore, allegedly correctly predicted the results of the four quarter-final matches, and also Spain's semi-final victory over Germany.
Sentence	17	The parakeet apparently thinks that the Netherlands will defeat Spain in the final.
Sentence	18	Which of the supposed oracles is correct remains to be seen.
Sentence	19	The final takes place on Sunday in Johannesburg, South Africa.

Sentence	1	 Munich, Germany
Sentence	2	The 69,000 capacity crowd at the Allianz Arena of football (soccer) fans watched Bayern pummel the Rostock goal to go top of the table.
Sentence	3	The match was academic after Klose's 66th minute goal when Rostock keeper Stefan Wächter spilled a Philipp Lahm shot and when he also took his career 1.Bundesliga total to 99 goals with a header in the 85th minute.
Sentence	4	The victory gave Bayern an early advantage over Stuttgart, Schalke and Werder Bremen, who finished 1st, 2nd and 3rd respectively last season.
Sentence	5	Ottmar Hitzfeld: “We’ve delivered the goods today.
Sentence	6	After Monday’s game in Burghausen, we knew the dangers posed by so-called underdogs, and Rostock have won three times in Munich in the past.
Sentence	7	We were very focused from the start, but there were four or five breaks where we saw that Hansa can play football.
Sentence	8	We gave them too much space, and I wasn’t pleased by that.
Sentence	9	The second half wasn’t easy either, because we didn’t get the second goal until late on.
Sentence	10	I’m delighted the risk with Toni worked out.
Sentence	11	He was a constant threat, and his presence also made Klose more effective.
Sentence	12	It’s good when strikers get off the mark in the first match, it takes the pressure off.“
Sentence	13	Miroslav Klose: “It was pretty good stuff for the first match, but no more than that.
Sentence	14	My partnership with Luca Toni’s already working very well.
Sentence	15	I hope we can keep it up, but we’ve got to do more with our chances, and work harder as a unit when we lose possession.“
Sentence	16	Luca Toni: “I haven’t been able to train with the team a great deal, but I really feel at home here.
Sentence	17	I believe things are going to go well.
Sentence	18	Obviously, it’s fantastic playing alongside Miroslav Klose, you’ve got to be delighted at having a partner as good as him.“
Sentence	19	Frank Pagelsdorf (Hansa Rostock): “Our school report for today would have noted that we were present.
Sentence	20	Bayern thoroughly deserved the margin of victory.
Sentence	21	We came here with big plans, but we couldn’t put them into action.
Sentence	22	We let them play far too much football, especially down the flanks in the second half.“

Sentence	8	Although the Bush Administration's policy on Iraq was seen as a major issue by voters, exit polls indicated that corruption was of greater concern.
Sentence	9	Republicans found themselves plagued by a series of scandals in recent months, ranging from the Jack Abramoff corruption scandal to revelations about sexual improprieties involving well-known Republicans, including Congressman Mark Foley and White House confidant Ted Haggard.
Sentence	10	Many conservative evangelical Christians, the GOP's most reliable voting block, have become disappointed by the scandals and may not vote in great numbers.

Sentence	28	Candidates in both New York and Michigan reported that automated telephone calls had been made to voters in the dead of night, purporting to be from their campaigns.
Sentence	29	The candidates said their campaigns had nothing to do with the calls, and had been made fraudulently in an attempt to make voters angry at them.
Sentence	30	It was unclear whether these calls were related to other calls, financed by the National Republican Congressional Committee, that had been made to voters in several states in the previous week.
Sentence	31	Those calls had generated complaints by voters from both parties who said they were repeated several times in the same day.
Sentence	32	In at least one state, the calls were pulled when the attorney general notified the NRCC that the calls violated state law.
Sentence	33	A different kind of "robocall" was reported in Iowa, where three Democratic candidates for the state House reported that they had been the target of anonymous attack ad calls.

Sentence	1	The "Downing Street memo" is the subject of a forum at the Washington Capitol complex today headed by Congressman John Conyers of the House Judiciary Committee and televised on C-SPAN 3.
Sentence	2	Conyers said that "there was a secret decision well ahead of the authority Congress had given" and that as the Bush administration "was assuring Congress, they were secretly planning war."
Sentence	3	The Downing Street Memo is the leaked minutes of a July, 2002 meeting in British prime minister Tony Blair's office which occurred eight months before the war in Iraq.
Sentence	4	The minutes say that "Bush wanted to remove Saddam through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.
Sentence	5	But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy."
Sentence	6	Gold Star Families for Peace is a group of families of Americans who were killed in Iraq.
Sentence	7	They also have been focusing on the British document and asking members of Congress to press for answers.
Sentence	8	The organization's leader, Cindy Sheehan, said the forum is "calling on Congress to do the right thing, to investigate the memo.
Sentence	9	I would hope that we would get an investigation going into the lies that lead our country into war and hold somebody accountable for those lies."
Sentence	10	Schneider said the minutes imply that "The Bush administration had already decided to go to war before asking for a vote of Congress, before going to the United Nations.

Article	112
Sentence	1	In a report on cloud computing issued this week, the environmental group Greenpeace rated ten top Internet companies, including Apple, Google, Twitter and Amazon, on several factors such as each company's willingness to be transparent by providing information on its energy sources and the energy efficiency of its data centers.
Sentence	2	In the report entitled "How Dirty is your Data", Apple, while receiving good marks for transparency, rated at the bottom for energy efficiency, primarily because its huge, new data center in North Carolina, called iDataCenter, relies largely on coal.
Sentence	3	Although Apple claimed its California operations used cleaner energy than that produced by most grids, iDataCenter has an estimated energy demand three times Apple's current use, significantly increasing Apple's environmental footprint.
Sentence	4	As Apple increases the online products it delivers from its iTunes platform, it will enlarge its cloud computing operations further.
Sentence	5	"Apple's decision to locate its iDataCenter in North Carolina, which has an electrical grid among the dirtiest in the country (61 percent coal, 31 percent nuclear), indicates a lack of a corporate commitment to clean energy supply for its cloud operations," Greenpeace said in its report.
Sentence	6	About 2 percent of worldwide energy use is consumed by data center computer servers, and this amount is increasing by 12 percent a year, Greenpeace reports, an energy demand that is more than that of Russia.
Sentence	7	Greenpeace said many IT companies do not reveal the environmental impact of their energy consumption, and concentrate more on energy efficiency that on using clean energy.
Sentence	8	Most of their energy is supplied by coal and nuclear energy.
Sentence	9	Companies are locating their data centers in areas that afford cheap, abundant coal-powered electricity.
Sentence	10	Yahoo was praised by Greenpeace for placing its data centers near sources of clean energy and its minor use of coal-based power.
Sentence	11	—Greenpeace
Sentence	12	Greenpeace noted that Google says that it is conscious of the need to use renewable sources of electricity to power cloud computing, but it does not acknowledge the size of its carbon footprint.
Sentence	13	The company claims it has seven data centers worldwide, but it is estimated to have 20 to 30.
Sentence	14	The carbon footprint of cloud computing is a recent emphasis of Greenpeace in its attempt to disprove the belief that the biggest polluters are manufacturers.
Sentence	15	—Timothy Prickett Morgan, The A Register
Sentence	16	In a response to the report, Timothy Prickett Morgan criticized Greenpeace for focusing on data centers which are responsible for using about 3 per cent of the US power generation and globally account for 1.5 to 2 percent.
Sentence	17	He noted that "the data centers of Amazon, Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, Twitter, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, Apple, and Akamai .
Sentence	18	.
Sentence	19	.
Sentence	20	are probably not much different from the business where you work every day when it comes to dependency on coal for electricity generation.
Sentence	21	And ditto for the home that you return to every night."
Sentence	22	Morgan quotes data from a 2008 report by the International Energy Agency and cited  by the World Coal Association, now known as the The World Coal Institute, that showed coal plants produce over 40 percent of the global electricity.
Sentence	23	The Institute determined that United States receives half of its power from coal plants.
Sentence	24	Some other countries, such as South Africa, Poland and China, use more coal.
Sentence	25	"The world is still dependent on non-renewable energy sources – coal and nuclear with a smattering of oil and gas – to generate electricity," he says, suggesting the IT companies should not be singled out.
Sentence	26	Morgan is also critical of Greenpeace's methodology in gathering the data, as it included only a sample of the data centers of these companies, and some that were not yet completely operational.
Sentence	27	He noted that because the companies were not always cooperative in disclosing information, Greenpeace estimated a portion of the data.
Sentence	28	He said that the reader has to "drill down into the report" to see the the complete picture.
Sentence	29	Another criticism of Greenpeace is its definition of coal and nuclear power as "dirty energy".
Sentence	30	Because it does not discharge greenhouse gases, nuclear power is rated more favorably than coal by some environmental organizations.
Sentence	31	Greenpeace is adamantly against nuclear power's radiation risks.

Sentence	1	Almost 1,000 people have been arrested in Iraq as part of a crackdown against al-Qaeda in Mosul, the nation's third-largest city.
Sentence	2	Troops have gone out into the surrounding countryside seeking many more who have fled into the countryside.
Sentence	3	It is hoped that Mosul, one of al-Qaeda's most prominent strongholds, will now be rid of the group but it is feared that unless the remaining suspects are caught they will simply regroup elsewhere, as they have been known to do before.
Sentence	4	Yassin Majid, an adviser to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, said most of the leaders had fled, some to an unnamed neighbouring country.
Sentence	5	About 60 miles from Mosul are borders with Syria and Turkey.
Sentence	6	"Operations will continue and the Iraqi army will not leave Mosul until security and stability have been accomplished," he said.
Sentence	7	Mark P. Hertling, head of US operations in North Iraq, who has troops involved in the operation, said he didn't believe large numbers were still at large since the Thursday launch of the operation, but added that many of the leaders may have fled before it began to avoid arrest.
Sentence	8	"It's been very successful.
Sentence	9	I think the combination of the arrests plus the uncovering of a number of weapons caches will reduce the number of attacks in Mosul."
Sentence	10	he said.
Sentence	11	The city is now surrounded by barriers and checkpoints and is being searched by troops, but no fighting has been reported yet.
Sentence	12	1,068 arrests were reported by Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani, who added that 94 have been cleared and released.
Sentence	13	Hertling said several of these were in high and mid-level positions in the command structure of al-Qaeda.
Sentence	14	Some of these are said to be suicide bomb cell leaders and people who arranged for foreign fighters to enter Iraq.
Sentence	15	The Prime Minister has promised an amnesty to fighters who surrender their weapons provided they have not killed civilians.

Article	263
Sentence	1	On Friday April 21, 2006 Associated Press released a story which has been reprinted in many newspapers throughout the United States.
Sentence	2	The article prints as factual several false and historically inaccurate assertions by Reverend Patterson, a Native Hawaiian sovereignty activist, who seems to have taken a 112 year old joke seriously.
Sentence	3	The direct falsehood reported as fact by Associated Press (not merely attributed to Reverend Patterson), and which Reverend Patterson uses as a basis for his April 30, 2006 "national day of prayer for Hawaiian natives", is as follows:
Sentence	4	"...it was Cleveland as president who set aside April 30, 1894 as a day of prayer and repentance over the U.S. role in the Hawaiian monarchy's overthrow."
Sentence	5	The fake proclamation attributed to President Grover Cleveland, was allegedly printed in the New York Sun February 26, 1894, and has been reported as real on several Hawaiian sovereignty websites; cited as real by Rev.
Sentence	6	Kaleo Patterson; and now reported as real by Associated Press in many newspapers.
Sentence	7	The misunderstanding regarding this joke proclamation started with Helena G. Allen, in her book "The Betrayal of Liliuokalani", pp.
Sentence	8	314-315, which provided the text of that proclamation.
Sentence	9	She did so in the context of discussing the constitution of the Republic of Hawai`i, despite the fact that the date on the proclamation was 4 months before a constitution was produced for the Republic of Hawaii.
Sentence	10	She wrote:
Sentence	11	Helena Allen cited its publication in the New York Sun, February 26, 1894.
Sentence	12	Allen does not say who arranged for the newspaper publication of this joke proclamation.
Sentence	13	She strongly implies it was Cleveland who actually authored the proclamation to show contempt for the revolutionary Hawai`i government headed by President Sanford B. Dole.
Sentence	14	But that interpretation is doubtful for a number of reasons.
Sentence	15	As a joke, it hardly seems very funny for Cleveland to be calling an officer of the government of the United States (John Stevens) "the devil."
Sentence	16	The description of the Provisional Government as a "miserable herd of missionaries" also doesn't come across as very humorous, since this was a government with which he had continuing diplomatic relations.
Sentence	17	The whole tone and tenor of the proclamation make President Cleveland seem emotional, irrational, insulting and arrogant.
Sentence	18	A more likely interpretation is that the joke was at the expense of President Cleveland -- his political opponents were poking fun at the zealousness of Grover Cleveland's continuing support for a deposed queen regarded by many as corrupt.
Sentence	19	The U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs published the Morgan Report the same day the joke proclamation was allegedly printed in the New York Sun.
Sentence	20	Washington politicians (including President Cleveland) had seen the Morgan Report beforehand, and knew the date it would be published.
Sentence	21	They knew the report would clear the U.S. of any wrongdoing in the overthrow of the monarchy, and support the legitimacy of the revolutionary Dole government.
Sentence	22	They knew the Morgan Report would severely criticize the royalist regime, and repudiate the Blount Report that Cleveland had orchestrated for the purpose of justifying his attempt to destabilize the Provisional Government and restore his friend Liliuokalani to the throne.
Sentence	23	Cleveland's enemies may have published the joke proclamation to poke fun at him.
Sentence	24	Regardless whether the joke proclamation was Cleveland's own expression of contempt for the Dole regime, or whether it was Cleveland's opponents' expression of contempt for the Cleveland regime -- either way, we know for sure that it was only a joke.
Sentence	25	The proclamation was never issued in any official way.
Sentence	26	It is not included in Cleveland's presidential messages and papers.
Sentence	27	The fake proclamation was apparently published in only one newspaper.
Sentence	28	President Grover Cleveland was a friend of Liliuokalani and was very aggressive in blocking annexation.
Sentence	29	During his first week in office he withdrew from the Senate a treaty of annexation proposed by the Hawai`i Provisional Government that had been approved by U.S. President Harrison; and he sent James Blount to Hawai`i.
Sentence	30	Blount went to Hawai`i, without Senate confirmation or even notification, as paramount minister plenipotentiary under secret orders.
Sentence	31	His actions while there seemed to imply a mission to destabilize the revolutionary government and to produce a report that would derail efforts in Congress to accept Hawai`i's offer of annexation.
Sentence	32	Blount took actions, which seemed to encourage a royalist counterrevolution, and wrote a report portraying theoverthrow of the monarchy as planned and supported by the U.S. rather than by local revolutionaries.
Sentence	33	Blount intervened to sabotage negotiations whereby Liliuokalani offered Dole that she would give up all claims to land and political power in return for a lifetime annuity.
Sentence	34	After the submission of Blount's report, Minister Willis, Cleveland's representative to Hawai`i, ordered President Dole to step down and to put Liliuokalani back on the throne.
Sentence	35	But despite all these things, after the U.S. Senate published the Morgan Report containing lengthy sworn testimony which repudiated the Blount Report, Cleveland changed his mind, gave formal diplomatic recognition to the Republic as the legitimate government of Hawai`i, and engaged in normal diplomatic negotiations with the Dole government on matters such as further implementation of treaties.
Sentence	36	As much as political activists may want to believe Cleveland declared April 30, 1894 as a day of mourning for their cause, the reality is that Cleveland made no such statement, and in fact treated the Republic of Hawaii with dignity and respect after his initial impressions regarding the Hawaiian Revolution were shown to be in error.
Sentence	37	Further research into the citation of Helena G. Allen referring to the New York Sun, February 26, 1894, has yielded no such article as she mentions.
Sentence	38	It is possible her citation was incorrect on the date, so further research into the February 25th, 1894 and February 27, 1894 editions will be conducted.
Sentence	39	Unfortunately, Helena G. Allen died in 2003, so she is not available to answer questions about her citation.

Article	117
Sentence	1	In the past two months, Parker Somerville, a videographer for the website TMZ.com, transitioned from an average guy leading an ordinary life, to living in an extraordinary voyeuristic existence, and back again to the beginning.
Sentence	2	Simply put, it was a transition from reality to reality, with a two-week detour in reality television.
Sentence	3	Somerville was a former contestant on the CBS reality TV staple Big Brother, currently in its ninth installment.
Sentence	4	Evicted on Day 14, Somerville hoped to have another chance to play the game, but came in second in the special "America's Choice" poll to bring back a former HouseGuest (the poll results were eventually not used at all and nobody was brought back).
Sentence	5	Now freed from a three-week sequester, Somerville was interviewed by Wikinews reporter Mike Halterman and he discussed his thoughts on Big Brother, how he and his fellow HouseGuests were portrayed and received, and what he plans to do now that his experience is, for the most part, over.
Sentence	6	Somerville will return to Big Brother on finale night in five weeks.
Sentence	7	Please check your local listings for time and channel.
Sentence	8	Big Brother airs on CBS in the United States, Global in Canada, and E4 in the United Kingdom.
Sentence	9	Mike Halterman: So, you've been billed on the show as a paparazzi for TMZ.com.
Sentence	10	Tell us exactly what you do at your job.
Sentence	11	What was your most exciting work-related celebrity sighting?
Sentence	12	MH: How much exposure did you have to Big Brother before you were selected to go on the show?
Sentence	13	MH: Who influenced you to audition?
Sentence	14	MH: In a previous interview I conducted with Canada's Next Top Model winner Andrea Muizelaar, she said that she believed reality shows cast people who are perhaps unstable, to make for better television.
Sentence	15	Do you feel that's true?
Sentence	16	MH: You were really not that thrilled when Jen, the "soulmate" the show picked for you, was in a previous outside relationship with fellow HouseGuest Ryan.
Sentence	17	What were you thinking when Jen revealed the news to you?
Sentence	18	MH: Also, Allison, Ryan's partner, was shown on the television broadcasts as being probably more angry than you were.
Sentence	19	Who do you think was more angry about the developments, you or Allison?
Sentence	20	MH: You were involved in some of the most dramatic moments we've seen this season, including, but not limited to, you waking up the entire house to find the person who had talked behind your back.
Sentence	21	Do you think being that direct was a good strategy for your game play?
Sentence	22	Also, viewers of the show gathered that you were unhappy with the way Jen played the game, but do you believe some of your actions cost you the game as well?
Sentence	23	MH: How do you feel about Jen telling other HouseGuests that her real-life boyfriend Ryan was racist to ensure that she stayed in the game?
Sentence	24	Did you think that behavior crossed a line?
Sentence	25	MH: You had said after leaving the house that you felt Matt didn't keep his word to you as far as vetoing your nomination.
Sentence	26	Now that you've watched past footage, do you still believe Matt wronged you?
Sentence	27	MH: What did you really want to say to Jen after you both got evicted so early in the game?
Sentence	28	You were very quiet when Julie Chen interviewed both of you...
Sentence	29	MH: This season, Big Brother made the press rather negatively compared to past seasons, specifically with incidents like HouseGuest Adam being fired from his job for a comment about "retards," Amanda being taunted that she should hang herself with a noose "just like her father," and James performing in multiple gay pornography videos.
Sentence	30	What are your thoughts about all of these these events?
Sentence	31	When do you think the other HouseGuests will find out about James' past in pornography, if they find out at all?
Sentence	32	How do you think Chelsia will react?
Sentence	33	MH: You were kept in sequester for a few weeks, and only recently allowed to return to your normal life.
Sentence	34	How does it feel being recognized as "that guy from the Big Brother show"?
Sentence	35	MH: What options, do you feel, are open to you now that your stint on reality TV is over?
Sentence	36	Are you going to continue your job at TMZ, or do you hope to break into acting like previous HouseGuests have?
Sentence	37	MH: You were in the Big Brother house for all of 14 days.
Sentence	38	With that TV experience behind you, would you ever consider doing another reality TV show again?
Sentence	39	MH: Who would you hang out with after the show ends, and who would you rather not see again?
Sentence	40	MH: There are eight contestants left from the original sixteen.
Sentence	41	Who are you rooting for to win, and why?
Sentence	42	MH: And finally, do you believe the Big Brother "twist" this season (both the "soulmate" pairings and Jen and Ryan's outside relationship) "robbed" you of winning the game?

Sentence	1	Led by Nizar Rayan, a senior Hamas fighter, hundreds of Palestinian refugees gathered to protect the house of the leader of a militant group in Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza and succeeded in thwarting an Israeli attack.
Sentence	2	As part of their campaign against Palestinian fighters, Israeli forces had warned Mohammedweil Baroud, a commander in the Popular Resistance Committee, that his house would be attacked in 30 minutes time.
Sentence	3	He was told to take his family out of the house in order to avoid civilian casualties.
Sentence	4	Instead, he called for help from the local mosque and people swarmed round and over Mr Baroud's house in such numbers as to dissuade the Israelis from making the promised attack.
Sentence	5	The Palestinians claimed this to have been the first successful defence of its kind.
Sentence	6	Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, visiting the house, said that people had been driven to this remedy because the UN had refused to defend them.
Sentence	7	On Friday, the Security Council vetoed a resolution condemning Israeli military action in Gaza.

Article	37
Sentence	1	The animated series Family Guy returned to the FOX television network with a new episode Sunday for the first time since it was taken off the schedule three years ago.
Sentence	2	Although the show kept most of its audience that lead-in The Simpsons gave, FOX was still fourth out of five major broadcast networks in the half-hour, losing most notably to ABC's hit Desperate Housewives (UPN, the other major American broadcast network, does not air original programming on Sundays).
Sentence	3	However, the season premiere of Family Guy and the series debut of American Dad (which helped usher in what the network termed "The New FOX Sunday") helped bring FOX to the #2 spot out of five networks in the crucial 18 to 49 demographic, one of the most important to advertisers in the key May sweeps period.
Sentence	4	"Sweeps" occurs four times a year and helps networks and independent affiliates determine how much a fixed amount of time for commercial advertisement will cost (the higher the ratings, the more revenue for the networks selling the time to advertisers).
Sentence	5	On the whole, Family Guy averaged a 6.3 rating in the overnights as posted by Zap2It.
Sentence	6	While the overnight ratings are fairly accurate, the numbers are preliminary and are subject to minor change.
Sentence	7	One ratings point is equal to 1,096,000 households, as there are now 109,600,000 households in the United States with at least one television.
Sentence	8	This translates into a little more than 6.9 million households whose sets were tuned into Family Guy, as recorded by the sample of "Nielsen families," who record their viewing habits and contribute to the ratings process the US uses.
Sentence	9	The use of the word "share" in the article means that it is the rough percentage of viewers with their sets on at that hour tuning into a certain program.
Sentence	10	For example, nine percent of viewers in the United States with their televisions on at 9 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time were tuned to Family Guy.
Sentence	11	This only added up to a 9 household share for the hour, compared to an 11 share for Law & Order: Criminal Intent on NBC, a 14 share for a CBS Hallmark Hall of Fame movie of the week (traditionally only aired during the key sweeps periods), and a 23 share for the aforementioned Desperate Housewives.
Sentence	12	Averaged with the performance of American Dad, a cartoon produced by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, FOX earned a mere 5.8 rating/9 share for the hour.
Sentence	13	The episode revolved around a big scheme Peter Griffin, the main character of the series, conjured.
Sentence	14	To give his wife Lois (who no longer finds him sexually attractive) a second honeymoon in order to "spice up" their love life, he pretends to be actor Mel Gibson so they can stay in a new luxury hotel for free.
Sentence	15	Peter stumbles upon a sequel to the film The Passion of the Christ, and vows to keep the movie from ever seeing the light of day.
Sentence	16	To get the movie back, Gibson kidnaps Lois and keeps her captive on top of Mount Rushmore, which leads to a scene in which the three battle on top of the monument, in a homage to the film North by Northwest.

Sentence	1	The Pentagon has drafted a revised plan for the Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations.
Sentence	2	This draft document is a revison of the Pentagon's Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations, Joint Publication 3-12, which is dated December 15, 1995.
Sentence	3	This draft redefines the purpose of United States's Nuclear forces to include "Assuring allies and friends of the US steadfastness of purpose and its capability to fulfill its security commitments."
Sentence	4	and "Dissuading adversaries from undertaking programs or operations that could threaten US interests or those of our allies and friends".
Sentence	5	This is a departure from the previous document which defined the purpose of the Nuclear Force as:
Sentence	6	The draft proposal also seeks to expand the definition of deterence to include US interests as well as threats to national security.
Sentence	7	The draft goes on to describe how deterence will work in cases of state actors using WMD:
Sentence	8	This again is a departure from the previous version, as pre-emption was not mentioned as a method for deterence to work.
Sentence	9	The current draft also suggests new scenarios for the United States to deploy nuclear forces, against biological or chemical attack on US, allied, or multinational forces, to counter overwhelming converntional forces, and against states supporting a non-state actor's use of WMD.
Sentence	10	This draft, like the previous version, also emphasizes that the US abhorrs the use of unrestricted warfare, and has codefied "laws of war".
Sentence	11	Critics of the draft argue that the "aggressive posture" outlined in this new document actually undermines US security.
Sentence	12	Hans Kristensen, of the Natural Resouces Defense Council, analyzed the draft in The Role of U.S. Nuclear Weapons: New Doctrine Falls Short of Bush Pledge.
Sentence	13	The draft document was written under the direction of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General Richard B. Meyers.
Sentence	14	The draft is going through a final coordination with various military branches and pentagon offices.
Sentence	15	The draft has not received final approval from United States Secretary of Defense, Donald H. Rumsfeld.

Sentence	1	A supposed "pregnancy pact" at Gloucester High School in Gloucester, Massachusetts has drawn international attention to the small Massachusetts fishing city which is considered to be one of the oldest settlements (1623) in the American continent.
Sentence	2	The story, which was broken by TIME magazine and the Boston Globe, involved the fact that 17 girls, all sixteen years old or younger, got themselves pregnant as part of a "pregnancy pact", so that the teenage mothers could raise their babies together.
Sentence	3	According the magazine article, school officials at the 1,162 student school became concerned starting as far back as October when a uncommonly large amount of girls began to enter the school's health clinic to see if they were pregnant.
Sentence	4	As of earlier this May, seven girls returned more than once seeking pregnancy tests and upon hearing results, "Some girls seemed more upset when they weren't pregnant than when they were," according to James Sullivan, the principal of the school.
Sentence	5	Some smiled, others cried, and one declared, "Sweet!
Sentence	6	", according to the Globe upon hearing their results.
Sentence	7	Local officials, including the mayor, are uncertain whether there really was a "pact", however.
Sentence	8	Mayor Carolyn Kirk called it a "blip" in the pregnancy rate and noted many factors playing into it, such glamorization of teen pregnancy including the announcement around the same time that Britney Spear's sister, Jamie Lynn Spears had given birth to a baby, and last year's critically acclaimed movie, Juno, a comedy about a 16-year-old girl who gets pregnant and other movies, such as Knocked Up.
Sentence	9	There is some concern over what might be statutory rape, as it has been reported that most of the men who are the fathers are older, including one report that one of the fathers is a 24-year-old homeless man.
Sentence	10	In Massachusetts, the age of consent is 16, therefore it is illegal for anyone to have sexual intercourse with anyone under 16.
Sentence	11	Other teen mothers however have criticized the new mothers.
Sentence	12	Two such girls are Alivia Fidler and Meaghan Orlando, childhood friends and sophomore students at the high school, the girls were 16 years old when they became pregnant unexpectedly.
Sentence	13	Orlando noted, "If I could go back in time I would want to wait and have the same baby later.
Sentence	14	You can't do stuff that normal teens do," who is now 17 and has a 3-month-old son named Jayden, "They don't know what they’re getting themselves into."
Sentence	15	Meaghan's friend, Alivia, also now 17, said the pact idea is "ridiculous."
Sentence	16	Noting, "They're not going to be friends very long.
Sentence	17	You have to take care of your baby.
Sentence	18	It's frustrating.
Sentence	19	I don't have a lot of support."
Sentence	20	Fidler is no longer with the father of the baby, 5 month-old  Xavier Fidler-Aguiar and recently lost her job at McDonalds.
Sentence	21	One other teen mother, Amanda Ireland, who recently graduated from the school, also gave a warning to the mothers, "Don't try to get pregnant.
Sentence	22	People say they know what it's like because they have younger siblings, but they really have no idea."
Sentence	23	Ireland also noted, "They're so excited to finally have someone to love them unconditionally.
Sentence	24	I try to explain it's hard to feel loved when an infant is screaming to be fed at 3 a.m."
Sentence	25	46 year-old Gloucester resident Lori Mitchell, whose daughter dropped out of high school at 16 to raise a child said there are worse things than being a teenage mother, "They could be junkies or prostitutes.
Sentence	26	You try to protect them as much as you can, but it's up to them to do the right thing."
Sentence	27	Greg Verga, the chairman of the Gloucester School Committee called the pact, "disturbing", as he himself was once a teen father.
Sentence	28	"They are going to have a rude awakening.
Sentence	29	It was no picnic.
Sentence	30	People don’t realize there’s 3 a.m. feedings ... it’s a lifestyle change.
Sentence	31	It’s not a possession you can play with and stick on the shelf.
Sentence	32	That's why I fear for these girls."

Sentence	14	The players are eager to win and that will help them play better in future.
Sentence	15	Nadine Angerer, Germany goalkeeper: I watched Brazil's game against Australia and although that time Marta went for the right corner with her penalty, I had a feeling that this time she would go for the left.
Sentence	16	So I decided to wait as long as possible - and it was the right decision.
Sentence	17	Cristiane, Brazil forward: Today we didn't play very well, we couldn't take our chances and Germany did, so that was the difference.
Sentence	18	It was a sad day but this team has done a very good job, we have 21 very talented players and I think we have given a very good example to the girls in Brazil.

Sentence	1	The first Old Firm Derby of the 2007-08 Scottish Premier League ended in a 3-0 victory for Rangers over Celtic.
Sentence	2	The result brings the two clubs level on points at the top of the table, although Rangers are ranked second on goal difference.
Sentence	3	The first chance of the match fell to Celtic when Scott McDonald, who played as a lone striker, tried an overhead kick which went wide.

Sentence	1	In Crawford, Texas, anti-war protesters led by American Cindy Sheehan, mother of a fallen soldier, have found a new place to demonstrate.
Sentence	2	"A kind gentleman from down the road, closer to the Bush ranch, has offered us the use of his property," said Sheehan to the reporters, as the camp prepared a move to private land.
Sentence	3	The property owner, U.S. Army veteran Fred Mattlage, said, "I just think people should have a right to protest without being harassed, and I'm against the war.
Sentence	4	I don't think it's a war we need to be in."
Sentence	5	Sheehan continued to tell the reporters, "He offered it because he heard about the shots fired at us the other day and he didn't think that was right.
Sentence	6	He happens to be the third cousin of the person that fired the shots and so he came down and he said he supports us 100 percent."
Sentence	7	The "shots fired" were those of nearby resident Larry Mattlage, whose land borders the protesters at their current location.
Sentence	8	After complaining about the proximity of the protesters, he fired a shotgun twice into the air Sunday - in order to prepare for duck hunting season, he said.
Sentence	9	Mattlage says at no time was he ever threatening the protesters with his shots.
Sentence	10	Not all Americans agree with Mrs. Sheehan's position.
Sentence	11	On Monday, a man was arrested and charged with vandalism of Camp Casey's memorial for troops lost in Iraq.
Sentence	12	Around 10pm the previous night, authorities say the accused used his pickup truck to run over hundreds of small wooden crosses bearing names of U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq.
Sentence	13	In comments to the press, Bush offered sympathy to Sheehan, "I sympathize with Mrs. Sheehan.
Sentence	14	She feels strongly about her -- about her position.
Sentence	15	And she has every right in the world to say what she believes.
Sentence	16	", he said.
Sentence	17	However, he has still declined to meet her.
Sentence	18	"I think it's important for me to be thoughtful and sensitive to those who have got something to say."
Sentence	19	Bush told reporters, "But, I think it's also important for me to go on with my life, to keep a balanced life."
Sentence	20	Others have commented that Sheehan is being used by those with their own agendas, "What started out as a grieving mom that we all sympathized with has now turned into ... an orchestrated far-left campaign," commented Greg Mueller, a conservative public-relations executive.
Sentence	21	A former FBI special agent, Rowley, and Becky Lourey, whose son was killed in Iraq, will leave for Texas on Thursday and camp at the site for a few days.
Sentence	22	Rowley said, "It puts a human face on this issue; many people, if they don't have a personal connection to the troops, it's so easy for this to become a discussion that lacks seriousness and urgency.
Sentence	23	I think it's good to show that there are real people that are being affected."
Sentence	24	"Our children are dying and I think it's time to go support Cindy and see if Bush will come out and we can say, 'President Bush, what is the mission exactly?
Sentence	25	'," Becky Lourey added.
Sentence	26	"Truth has been shifting all around and I think we need to rejoin the world community and not occupy another nation."
Sentence	27	Lourey said.
Sentence	28	Sheehan wants the withdrawal of all troops from Iraq.
Sentence	29	President Bush claims that leaving Iraq now wouldn't be helpful for Iraqis or Americans, but only for terrorists.

Article	315
Sentence	1	At least 20 people have died and 20 more are injured after a partially constructed flyover (overpass) in Hyderabad, India collapsed onto traffic.
Sentence	2	The disaster occurred at the Panjagutta junction, near Nagarjuna Circle.
Sentence	3	Two large concrete sections dropped onto oncoming cars and motorised rickshaws, damaging several severely.
Sentence	4	A large emergency effort was immediately activated, but experienced severe difficulties in reaching the site due to congested traffic resulting from the collapse.
Sentence	5	Ambulances from the 108 EMRI Service and Appollo Hospitals attended the scene, and rushed the injured to a variety of nearby hospitals.
Sentence	6	All the region's major hospitals, particularly the nearby Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences, have placed their medical staff on emergency alert.
Sentence	7	Rescuers are now using cranes and cutting equipment in an effort to reach anyone who may still be trapped.
Sentence	8	It is expected that the death toll could rise further as many vehicles remain trapped under tons of debris.
Sentence	9	Various politicians also attended the scene, including the local district collector, Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Dr. YS Rajasekhara Reddy, Senior Congress Leader and MLA from Khairathabad P Janardhan Reddy and several other ministers.
Sentence	10	Police have asked both the public and the press to keep away from the area, in order to prevent further collapse of the unstable structure.
Sentence	11	Preliminary investigations suggest the flyover had been been poorly constructed.
Sentence	12	The construction project had been carried out by leading contractor Gammon India Limited.
Sentence	13	It had been delayed, the original foundations having been built in 2005.
Sentence	14	After a successful request by the company to have the deadline for the project extended, work was slated to cease in November of this year, with the flyover entering operation by December.
Sentence	15	It is believed heavy rains in the area a few hours prior to the collapse may have contributed to the disaster.

Article	370
Sentence	1	A 20-year old male turned the tables on an abusive police officer in St. George, Missouri after he was pulled over inside a commuter parking lot by officer Sgt.
Sentence	2	James Kuehnlein of the St. George police department.
Sentence	3	The St. Louis, Missouri man, Brett Darrow, 20, had installed a hidden camera inside his car, much like the way some police officers do, and caught the entire incident on tape.
Sentence	4	Darrow then posted the video on the internet on places like YouTube.com.
Sentence	5	In the beginning of the nearly 13 minute video, the police officer states that Darrow was being pulled over because his vehicle "seemed suspicious."
Sentence	6	Officer Kuehnlein claims that high crime rates in the lot caused Darrow to be pulled over.
Sentence	7	Kuehnlein then asks Darrow to step out of the car and asks to see his ID.
Sentence	8	Darrow then asks what he did wrong and Kuehnlein then blows up on the boy saying "do you want to try me?
Sentence	9	Do you want to try me tonight?
Sentence	10	You think you had a bad night?
Sentence	11	I will ruin your fucking night.
Sentence	12	Try me young boy."
Sentence	13	Kuehnlein then threatens to send Darrow to jail for "some fucking reason I come up with" and we'll "see who knows the law better.
Sentence	14	Don't ever get smart mouth with a cop again or I will show you what a cop does."
Sentence	15	Kuehnlein then begins to threaten Darrow with a list of false charges such as resisting arrest.
Sentence	16	He can also "come up with nine other things" for every one thing Darrow can come up with.
Sentence	17	Kuehnlein then tells Darrow that he was being ticketed for not using a turn signal to turn into the lot, but the video clearly proves the officer wrong.
Sentence	18	During the entire incident, Darrow barely spoke a word as the officer threatened him saying "I just had a bad night."
Sentence	19	Darrow is then allowed to go, but only after Kuehnlein notices the camera, and not before threatening Darrow some more saying "I don't really care about your cameras, 'cause I'm about ready to tow your car, then we can tear 'em all apart."
Sentence	20	After the video was posted on the internet, people from all over started to call the police department and complain about the officers actions.
Sentence	21	"I was very displeased when I saw the actions on the video.
Sentence	22	My officers are not trained and taught to act like that," said Scott Uhrig, chief of the St. George police who added "someone either violated the law or they didn't.
Sentence	23	You don't say, I'll lock you up and then come up with why afterward."
Sentence	24	Darrow states that he did not take the video to the police chief because he thought the whole thing would be forgotten and "swept under the rug.
Sentence	25	I wanted everybody to see that this kind of stuff does happen."
Sentence	26	Pending an investigation of the incident, Kuehnlein was suspended without pay.

Article	4
Sentence	1	The Internet-based group "Anonymous" has released statements on YouTube and via a press release, outlining what they call a "War on Scientology".
Sentence	2	Church of Scientology related websites, such as religiousfreedomwatch.org have been removed due to a suspected distributed denial-of-service-attack (DDoS) by a group calling themselves "Anonymous".
Sentence	3	On Friday, the same group allegedly brought down Scientology's main website, scientology.org, which was available sporadically throughout the weekend.
Sentence	4	Several websites relating to the Church of Scientology have been slowed down, brought to a complete halt or seemingly removed from the Internet completely in an attack which seems to be continuous.
Sentence	5	The scientology.org site was back online briefly on Monday, and is currently loading slowly.
Sentence	6	On Monday, the group released a video titled: "Message to Scientology" on YouTube concerning their intentions to attack the Church of Scientology.
Sentence	7	A robotic voice on the video begins with "Hello leaders of Scientology.
Sentence	8	We are Anonymous," and continues by explaining their motivations: "Over the years we have been watching you, your campaigns of misinformation, your suppression of dissent and your litigious nature.
Sentence	9	All of these things have caught our eye.
Sentence	10	With the leakage of your latest propaganda video into mainstream circulation the extent of your malign influence over those who have come to trust you as leaders has been made clear to us.
Sentence	11	Anonymous has therefore decided that your organisation should be destroyed."
Sentence	12	The message goes on to state that the group intends to "expel Scientology from the Internet".
Sentence	13	As of Wednesday, the video had been viewed 370,347 times, favorited 2,473 times, and is currently YouTube's top third video of the day.
Sentence	14	—The Michigan Daily
Sentence	15	The "Message to Scientology" video was highlighted as the "YouTube Video of the Week" by The Michigan Daily.
Sentence	16	Commenting on the video, the piece states "if this video is any indication, it seems like the assailants mean business".
Sentence	17	In a blog post on USA Today's website, Jess Zielinski wrote that it was "not a shock that hackers hold a grudge against Scientology," and in a followup post on another USA Today blog, Angela Gunn wrote that "those of us who remember ... the adventures of Operation Clambake are fascinated to see this kind of thing flare up again".
Sentence	18	Blogging for Wired magazine, Ryan Singel wrote about the incident in a piece on Wednesay titled "War Breaks Out Between Hackers and Scientology -- There Can Be Only One".
Sentence	19	Singel wrote that the Project Chanology wiki page "directs Anonymous members to download and use denial of service software, make prank calls, host Scientology documents the Church considers proprietary, and fax endless loops of black pages to the Church's fax machines to waste ink".
Sentence	20	According to Wired, "The Church of Scientology did not immediately respond to a call for comment".
Sentence	21	The viewpoints expressed in the video are echoed on the "Project Chanology" website, an open source of information and direction for those within Anonymous, which talks of tactics such as blackfaxing and prank calling alongside other "real-life" methods of attack.
Sentence	22	The satirical website Encyclopedia Dramatica also has a similar page devoted to "Project Chanology".
Sentence	23	—"Anonymous" - Press Release
Sentence	24	"Anonymous" released a statement on Monday in the form of a press release, "Internet Group Anonymous Declares "War on Scientology": "Anonymous" are fighting the Church of Scientology and the Religious Technology Center".
Sentence	25	In the statement, the group explained their goal as safeguarding the right to freedom of speech "A spokesperson said that the group's goals include bringing an end to the financial exploitation of Church members and protecting the right to free speech, a right which they claim was consistently violated by the Church of Scientology in pursuit of its opponents."
Sentence	26	The press release also claimed that the Church of Scientology misused copyright and trademark law in order to remove criticism from websites including Digg and YouTube.
Sentence	27	The statement goes on to assert that the attacks from the group "will continue until the Church of Scientology reacts, at which point they will change strategy".
Sentence	28	The attack was reportedly motivated by the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove a promotional video featuring Scientologist Tom Cruise from YouTube.
Sentence	29	After the Church of Scientology lodged a copyright infringement complaint with YouTube, the site took down the video.
Sentence	30	The Tom Cruise video is still available on Gawker.com, which has stated it will not remove the video "It's newsworthy, and we will not be removing it."
Sentence	31	—Gawker.com
Sentence	32	Gawker.com discussed the actions of the "Anonymous" group, in a post on Monday titled "Scientology vs. the Internet: Why Kids On The Internet Are Scientology's Most Powerful Enemy".
Sentence	33	Gawker.com briefly outlined actions of other anonymous users critical of Scientology, including actions taken in the past by users of YouTube, Digg, and YTMND "This isn't the only group of Internet users unafraid of the intimidating cult; a whole range of sites has turned the Church into a mockery by doing what mainstream celebrity-coverage outlets wouldn't dare."
Sentence	34	A poster on the newsgroup alt.religion.scientology (a.r.s.)
Sentence	35	was critical of the actions by the "Anonymous" group.
Sentence	36	In a post titled "Open Letter to Anonymous" Jeff Jacobsen, webmaster of lisamcpherson.org, posting as "cultxpt" wrote that "It's understandable that people get upset over the things the Church of Scientology has done online and off", pointing out that the Church of Scientology had "tried to shut down a.r.s.
Sentence	37	", and "spam our newsgroup to this day".
Sentence	38	In 1999 "sporgery", a form of nonsensical spam tactic, was used as an attempt to disrupt discussion on the newsgroup.
Sentence	39	Previously in 1995 Helena Kobrin, an attorney for the Church of Scientology, attempted to remove the a.r.s.
Sentence	40	group from Usenet.
Sentence	41	Kobrin sent a rmgroup message which stated: "We have requested that the alt.religion.scientology newsgroup be removed from all sites".
Sentence	42	This later led to a declaration of war by the hacker group Cult of the Dead Cow, and an increase in popularity of the a.r.s site.
Sentence	43	This initial conflict came to be known as "Scientology versus the Internet".
Sentence	44	The post from Jacobsen went on to criticize the actions of the "Anonymous" group, stating: "We're supposed to be the good people," and stated that contrary to the Anonymous group's tactics, "Our weapons as critics are reason, evidence, argument, and free speech".
Sentence	45	—Andreas Heldal-Lund, Operation Clambake
Sentence	46	On Tuesday, the founder of Operation Clambake, a non-profit organization and website critical of Scientology based in Stavanger, Norway, released a statement about the attacks by "Anonymous".
Sentence	47	Andreas Heldal-Lund was critical of the "Anonymous" groups actions, stating: "The author of Operation Clambake does not condone such activity.
Sentence	48	Attacking Scientology like that will just make them play the religious persecution card.
Sentence	49	They will use it to defend their own counter actions when they try to shatter criticism and crush critics without mercy."
Sentence	50	Heldal-Lund went on to emphasize the right of all people and organizations to freedom of speech - including the Church of Scientology: "Freedom of speech means we need to allow all to speak - including those we strongly disagree with.
Sentence	51	I am of the opinion that the Church of Scientology is a criminal organisation and a cult which is designed by its delusional founder to abuse people.
Sentence	52	I am still committed to fight for their right to speak their opinion."

Article	73
Sentence	1	At the end of January, Bach Technology announced their new music file format, MusicDNA, which was developed as an intended replacement for the mp3 format, which has been the dominant format in music since its inception.
Sentence	2	MusicDNA uses similar compression methods to mp3, but then also adds an xml file which defines other content that can be included.
Sentence	3	Wikinews reporter Tristan Thomas caught up with Bach Technology CEO Stefan Kohlmeyer to find out more.
Sentence	4	((Wikinews)) Thank you for agreeing to answer our questions.
Sentence	5	((WN)) Can you briefly explain what MusicDNA is?
Sentence	6	((Stefan Kohlmeyer)) We believe that MusicDNA is the successor to the MP3, the MusicDNA media extension enables music fans to access from one application the wide range of music-related content they want alongside the music itself - from lyrics, artwork and tour dates to blog posts, videos and twitter feeds.
Sentence	7	In addition to all this extra content, MusicDNA files are also intelligent, and include extensive audio analysis information for each single track.
Sentence	8	This means that search and recommendation tools or automatic playlist generators will be much more sophisticated and provide much better results.
Sentence	9	((WN)) How long has it been in development and what role has Karlheinz Brandenburg, the man credited with inventing mp3, played in that?
Sentence	10	((SK)) In essence MusicDNA in its current context has been in development since the start of the company in 2007.
Sentence	11	Bach has an important strategic partnership with Fraunhofer IDMT with its CEO Karlheinz Brandenburg who is an important person for us in all research projects and visionary discussions about the development of the music market.
Sentence	12	((WN))  Is this just going to be another consumer hurting format war with iTunes LP?
Sentence	13	What makes MusicDNA better than iTunes LP?
Sentence	14	((SK)) Unlike iTunes LP, MusicDNA files have been built on open standards and are completely platform agnostic, which means that, unlike iTunes LP, you’re not tied to one device or media player.
Sentence	15	So it’s about the opposite of format wars really.
Sentence	16	Whilst LP goes some way to adding value to digital music, it is still essentially a static file with some extra content bolted on.
Sentence	17	MusicDNA not only gives back all the things we lost when we switched to digital formats, lyrics, liner notes, artwork, but crucially it goes beyond that allowing fans to access everything from Twitter feeds and videos through to concert tickets, this will all dynamically update whenever you're online, so music fans always have the latest information to hand.
Sentence	18	Importantly with MusicDNA you can customise single tracks, you’re not restricted to purchasing complete albums as you are with LP.
Sentence	19	And because all the additional rich media is integrated into the file (unlike iTunes LP), that content can be easily transferred from one device to another.
Sentence	20	Mark Mulligan, vice president and research director of industry analysts Forrester Research recently put it well to the UK’s Telegraph newspaper "innovations like the iTunes LP need to go further.
Sentence	21	People should pay just once to get everything that artist does over the next year in one file that is regularly updated."
Sentence	22	((WN)) Is this really what listeners want-more clutter to distract from the music itself?
Sentence	23	What's wrong with mp3?
Sentence	24	—Stefan Kohlmeyer
Sentence	25	((SK)) A lot of people, especially those who grew up buying music on vinyl and CD, miss the packaging, the liner notes, all the things that went hand in hand with albums, so for them that ‘clutter’ is an important part of the experience.
Sentence	26	We developed MusicDNA based on how people interact with their favourite music and musicians today, so we’re just following the public’s lead in many ways.
Sentence	27	MusicDNA enables fans to stay constantly connected with the worlds of their favourite artists in a really convenient way.
Sentence	28	Importantly, MusicDNA files can be customised so that they contain as little or much extra content as the listener wants.
Sentence	29	You have to remember the MP3 was developed over twenty years ago, think of how much has changed in that time.
Sentence	30	It has had a profound effect on the music industry, but beyond portability it doesn't actually add anything to the experience, the opposite in fact.
Sentence	31	((WN)) Will MusicDNA be any less susceptible to piracy than other formats?
Sentence	32	((SK)) As only paid for files will dynamically update MusicDNA should be an incentive for people to purchase legitimate files rather than downloading them from p2p networks.
Sentence	33	Over the last decade a lot of effort has gone into trying to stop piracy through sanctions and enforcement, and, well, the results speak for themselves.
Sentence	34	We believe in a carrot approach, giving the public what they actually want and a great incentive to go the legit route.
Sentence	35	((WN)) Many people argue that music is moving away from being owned and more towards models like Spotify; free, streamed music.
Sentence	36	Is MusicDNA not too late to the party if this is so?
Sentence	37	((SK)) Like many in the industry Bach are of the view that there is no one silver bullet to suit all types of consumer, rather a variety of services will serve different fans with different needs.
Sentence	38	There are many occasions when a download is preferable to a stream, and MusicDNA  files have the advantage of customised, at your fingertips, rich media available on- and offline.
Sentence	39	And that is before considering the impact of streaming on growing bandwidth and energy requirements.
Sentence	40	((WN)) So when will we start to see MusicDNA and where?
Sentence	41	((SK)) Rollout will be staggered over 2010, with the first beta versions available around Easter and the full commercial rollout expected over summer.
Sentence	42	((WN)) And finally, your favourite artist at the moment to be released on MusicDNA this year?
Sentence	43	((SK)) It's too early to say, but we're in talks with some very exciting artists.
Sentence	44	I would love to see all my old heroes on MusicDNA, starting with Led Zeppelin and The Clash.
Sentence	45	((WN)) Thank you again for your time.
Sentence	46	Good luck with the launch.

Article	305
Sentence	1	Bushfires across the Australian state of Victoria have killed at least 108 people and have destroyed dozens of homes.
Sentence	2	These fires were caused by a severe heat wave affecting the country, combined with winds reported to have reached gale force.
Sentence	3	According to a report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the fires have burned approximately 30,000 acres (12,140 hectares) of land since they began on Friday.
Sentence	4	State police officials stated that there are still several more fires being fought, and feared that the death toll could reach as much as double the currently confirmed number when all fires are extinguished and investigations begin.
Sentence	5	Temperatures in Victoria today reached 46° Celsius (115° Fahrenheit), with the combination of temperatures and high winds helped to fuel the fires.
Sentence	6	The fire was reported to be moving at an estimated 60 kilometers per hour (40 miles per hour).
Sentence	7	"This has been an absolute tragedy for the state and we believe this figure may only get worse.
Sentence	8	We're concerned this figure could even reach up into the 40s," stated Kieran Walshe, the Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner, referring to the death toll.
Sentence	9	"The whole of Kinglake is ablaze, I live a couple of kilometers out of town, I heard explosions, by the time I got to the road there were fires everywhere.
Sentence	10	[There is] flame everywhere, trees exploding, gas tanks exploding, buildings on fire, it's very, very, very serious," said a resident of Kinglake, a small township north of Melbourne that was greatly affected by the flames.
Sentence	11	"I can't quite see down into the main stretch of town, but there's a lot of flame coming up from there, so I presume most of the town is going up," he also stated.
Sentence	12	Kinglake has had the most deaths in the fire outbreak so far, where it was reported that six people traveling in a car were all killed when it was set ablaze by the raging flames.
Sentence	13	Over 30,000 volunteers are currently fighting the blazes across the country, along with the help of helicopters and aircraft dropping chemicals and water onto the site hoping to help extinguish the fire.
Sentence	14	Greg Esnouf, the Victoria Country Fire Authority deputy chief, stated that conditions for firefighters were "off the scale" dangerously, and also stated that the forecast for Sunday would not be different than the previous few days.
Sentence	15	Victoria Police have reported that they are suspecting that some of the fires were lit through arson, and are currently in the process of questioning a resident about a fire that started outside of the city.
Sentence	16	Another man was arrested in connection with deliberately lighting the fire, but was released by police and had arson charges dropped.
Sentence	17	According to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the heat wave is expected to continue throughout the weekend and peaking in the southeastern part of the country, with temperatures not expected to get cooler until early next week.

Sentence	1	On Saturday, 188 supporters of Fatah were allowed to enter Israel from the Gaza Strip, said one IDF spokesman.
Sentence	2	The Fatah supporters were fleeing after a bloody conflict in Gaza City.
Sentence	3	Defense minister Ehud Barak was the one who gave the permission for the Palestinians to enter Israel.
Sentence	4	Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas requested that they be allowed in on Saturday, according to the spokesman, as a result of Hamas' capture of a neighborhood in Gaza City.
Sentence	5	The Palestinians entered Israel at the checkpoints near Nahal Oz and Erez, kibbutzes near the border of the northern section of the Gaza Strip.
Sentence	6	They were disarmed, prior to being allowed across the border.
Sentence	7	In addition, they will be asked about the circumstances which lead them to seek refuge in Israel, said the spokesman.
Sentence	8	Late Saturday evening, Hamas militants took control of a eastern Gaza City neighborhood, al-Shojaeya.
Sentence	9	The Hamas police surrounded a house belonging to the pro-Fatah Helis clan, a family believed to be harboring the terrorists responsible for the July 25 bombing which claimed the lives of a six year old girl and 5 others.
Sentence	10	The battle left 4 dead, two of them Hamas militants, and close to 80 wounded.
Sentence	11	The spokesman said that "they [the Palestinians] were asking to enter the state of Israel after being threatened by Hamas gunmen."
Sentence	12	The majority of the Palestinians entering Israel were from the Helis clan that had been involved in the gun battle.
Sentence	13	22 of the of 188 were wounded, with the majority of the injuries being minor.
Sentence	14	Ambulances from Magen David Adom took 3 of the more severely injured to Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba as well as Barzilai Hospital in Ashkelon.
Sentence	15	The rest were transported to Ramallah in the West Bank.
Sentence	16	The act of allowing the Palestinians to cross into Israel could perhaps be a sign of Israel's support, according to CNN.
Sentence	17	The IDF spokesman stated that "it was a sort of humane gesture."

Sentence	3	A 9-year-old boy was hit with the stone, and suffered a wound to his head requiring medical assistance.
Sentence	4	Since then, Cuevas has spent one month under house arrest pending court.
Sentence	5	Cuevas' lawyer, Richard Beshwate, told the BBC that "They [Fresno police] are treating her like a violent parole offender.
Sentence	6	It's not a felony, it's an 11-year-old acting like an 11-year-old."

Sentence	10	"The shooter is not dead, but in custody in stable condition."
Sentence	11	Initial reports said that the gunman had been shot to death by military police; however, General Cone now says that the man is in custody and is in the hospital with injuries, but is in stable condition.

Sentence	71	At first we thought he meant help the armed forces, but apparently that wasn't the case.
Sentence	72	Other times he would make comments we shouldn't be in the war in the first place."
Sentence	73	Security officials said that some Internet postings made half a year ago, discussing suicide bombings and other forms of violence, appeared to have been posted by Hasan, but this has not been officially confirmed.
Sentence	74	Some army bases around the US increased security measures following the attacks.

Sentence	81	As we are watching and listening, there is a lot we don't know."
Sentence	82	—Barack Obama
Sentence	83	President Barack Obama described the incident as "a horrific outburst of violence" in a press conference in Washington D.C., going on to say, "It is difficult enough when we lose these brave men and women abroad, but it is horrifying that they should come under fire at an army base on US soil.
Sentence	84	[...] We will make sure that we get answers to every single question about this horrible incident.
Sentence	85	We are going to stay on this."
Sentence	86	Texas Senator Hutchison released a statement regarding the incident.
Sentence	87	"I am shocked and saddened by today's outburst of violence at Fort Hood that has cost seven of our brave service members their lives and has gravely injured others.
Sentence	88	My heart goes out to their loved ones," she said.
Sentence	89	"Our dedicated military personnel have sacrificed so much in service to our country, and it sickens me that the men and women of Fort Hood have been subjected to this senseless, random violence.

Sentence	102	Fort Hood is one of our nation's finest and largest military installations, and a place that has long been a source of pride for Texans, and for all Americans who value the selfless service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform," the statement read.
Sentence	103	"It is imperative that we take the time to gather all the facts, as it would be irresponsible to be the source of rumors or inaccurate information regarding such a horrific event.
Sentence	104	Once we have ascertained all the facts, working with our military leaders and law enforcement officials on the ground, we can determine what exactly happened at Fort Hood today and how to prevent something like this from ever happening again."
