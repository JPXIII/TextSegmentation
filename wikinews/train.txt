Sentence	8	"Whose idea was that?	0
Sentence	9	It’s just ridiculous."	0
Sentence	10	When an aide asked what Duffy had said, Brown responded: "Everything, she was just a bigoted woman that said she used to be Labour [...] I don't know why Sue [an aide] brought her up towards me."	0

Sentence	20	He does not think that she is bigoted.	0

Sentence	1	Wikinews reported on May 17 that several weeks earlier British police had picked up an unidentified man wandering the streets of Sheerness, United Kingdom.	1
Sentence	2	The man who has thus far refused to talk, has demonstrated himself to be an excellent pianist—earning him the nickname Piano Man.	0
Sentence	3	Since publication of our first article, we have been contacted by a fellow wiki contributor informing us that the Piano Man may be a British actor named Geoffrey Betts.	1
Sentence	4	Although our contact strongly believed he knew the identity of the man and contacted the relevant authorities in regard to his belief, this has turned out to be false.	0
Sentence	5	While Betts was not reachable by phone or e-mail, his website was recently updated to the effect that he is not the man in question.	0
Sentence	6	In the meantime, the search for the identity has been narrowed down to three leads by authorities.	0
Sentence	7	The original interview between Wikinews editor CGorman and contributor Steve Magruder is reproduced below.	1
Sentence	8	CG: Who do you think the pianist is?	1
Sentence	9	S:  Geoffrey "Geoff" Betts, an actor and British citizen, who I last knew to be living in Euless, Texas (a suburb of Dallas), and who, the last time I saw him was living temporarily months at a time in Louisville, Kentucky.	0
Sentence	10	CG: Why do you think it is him?	1
Sentence	11	S:  The person I knew should be 26, perhaps almost 27 now.	0
Sentence	12	The personal resemblances are the eyes, facial shape, asymmetric jawline, ears, nose and short hair.	0
Sentence	13	The person I knew had colored his hair blonde at least one time when I knew him.	0
Sentence	14	His mother is Italian, and his father is British, and the "Piano Man" has the appearance of such an ethnic combination.	0
Sentence	15	I also knew that he composed music, but frankly, I did not know he could play the piano.	0
Sentence	16	Both the man found and Geoff are thin and physically fit.	0
Sentence	17	I also knew Geoff to be a smart dresser.	0
Sentence	18	CG: What is your relationship with Mr. Betts; were you good friends?	1
Sentence	19	S:  He is a former business associate of an ex-partner of mine in an upstart film production company that has since gone out of business.	0
Sentence	20	Geoff actually lived with us for periods of time in 2003.	0
Sentence	21	I would call him a friendly acquaintance, if not a friend, during that time.	0
Sentence	22	(...)	1
Sentence	23	CG: What is your knowledge of Mr. Betts' musical ability?	1
Sentence	24	S: I knew Geoff to compose his own music, but I cannot remember offhand what kind of music.	0
Sentence	25	CG: When was the last time you met Mr. Betts - was it long before the man turned up in England?	1
Sentence	26	S: Early 2004, when Geoff last moved out of the residence where I and my ex-partner were living.	0
Sentence	27	I had heard various stories for months after that point regarding him continuing to live in Texas and occasionally visit Louisville, but I had no firsthand knowledge of that.	0
Sentence	28	CG: What was Mr. Betts involved in in the weeks before the appearance of the man in England?	1
Sentence	29	Was he working on a film, on a break etc?	0
Sentence	30	S: According to IMDB, Geoff was working on a film recently, but I am not sure of the timing of that with respect to the time the man appeared in England.	0
Sentence	31	I have no information on where he might have been in the weeks before the man's appearance.	0
Sentence	32	CG: On a scale of 1 to 10, how sure are you that the man is actually Mr. Betts?	1
Sentence	33	S: 8.	0
Sentence	34	I admit I am not as confident as the Polish man living in Italy was (with his 99% certainty that it was his friend Massone), and it turned out he was incorrect.	0
Sentence	35	I have to say, however, that I am haunted by how much the "Piano Man" resembles Geoff.	0
Sentence	36	Further, the reports indicate the man is 6' while Geoff is 5'10"--I don't know whether the man found was measured with his shoes on or not.	0
Sentence	37	Last, my attempts to contact Geoff by a direct email address I found has failed to get any response.	0
Sentence	38	I am almost tossing and turning with cognitive dissonance about whether the man found could be Geoff or not.	0
Sentence	39	CG: I know you have already contacted the relevant authorities, but if there was one thing about Mr. Betts that you believe could help further in verification of the pianists identity; what would it be?	1
Sentence	40	S:  Geoff's website at http://www.geoffreybetts.com for physical comparison.	0
Sentence	41	Also, his mother may still be living in Euless, TX.	0
Sentence	42	Last, strangely enough, he also had a wish list at Amazon.com, and one of the last two items he added on April 4 (apparently just before the appearance of the man in England) is an audio CD titled "Silence."	0
Sentence	43	A comparison can be made of images of the Piano Man and Geoff using the below links:	1

Sentence	17	In his review of the book, Dave Shiflett of The Wall Street Journal commented on the litigious nature of the Church of Scientology, writing "Mr. Morton, apparently unfazed by the reputation of the group's notoriously hair-triggered legal department, leaves few stones unhurled."	0
Sentence	18	Shortly before the book's publication, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring Tom Cruise promoting his beliefs appeared on the Internet.	1

Sentence	2	One year and one month after the earthquake that affected most of Chile, and triggered a destructive tsunami throughout its coast, the governor of the Cardenal Caro Province, Julio Ibarra, told El Mercurio Online that the Pichilemu Municipality "did not register, nor conducted inspection visits" to the homes of 107 families affected by the earthquake.	1
Sentence	3	Their registration, and the inspection visits are a needed step for those families, in order to request housing subsidies given by the government because of the catastrophe.	0
Sentence	4	"We found a list of persons that had requested inspection visits from the Public Works Department [of the Pichilemu Municipality], and we were surprised to notice that that people were not registered in our system, and that the director of the Public Works Department never visited them.	1
Sentence	5	There is a double fault, an absolute abandonment, because the applications for the subsidies are now closed," Julio Ibarra said.	0
Sentence	6	"[...] We have received criticism that we have not advanced in terms of reconstruction, and the responsibility of giving the information [to the government] is the municipality," Ibarra added.	1
Sentence	7	The governor gave the detailed information of the families to the General Comptroller of the Republic (Contraloría General de la República), and is requesting special extension of the deadlines for application to the Ministry of Housing.	0
Sentence	8	"We are overdue in the issue of housing reconstruction.	1
Sentence	9	[...] The Ministry of Housing did not create a special program for the housing reconstruction, they are using the same programs implemented in 2004, [or] 2005, to try to give a solution to the people," Mayor of Pichilemu, Roberto Córdova, told Wikinews in November 2010.	0

Sentence	3	When police arrived to investigate and retrieve the assaulting dogs, they entered the house and found the 12 fire bombs.	0
Sentence	4	It is not known what the devices were made of or what the explosive material was, but unconfirmed reports say the main explosive source was gasoline.	0
Sentence	5	The Hazmat team, the bomb squad, and emergency services were then dispatched to the scene to dispose of the devices, according to witness reports.	1
Sentence	6	It is not known where they were taken.	0
Sentence	7	Both dogs were immediately put to sleep because they were fighting over the body of the dead dog.	1
Sentence	8	It is not known who is the owner of the dogs, as the house was not rented, and no one was supposed to be living there.	0

Sentence	1	A 12 year old boy turned up to start the new academic year as a girl, at a school in England.	1
Sentence	2	The boy, who will remain unnamed, arrived for his first day at secondary school in Sussex in southern England wearing a dress, and with long hair in ribboned pigtails.	1
Sentence	3	His parents have had his name changed to a girl's by deed poll, and the boy is now preparing for hormone treatment and eventual surgery.	0
Sentence	4	Former classmates from primary school noticed the change, and the boy was the subject of taunting, including being asked by other children if he was "gay".	1
Sentence	5	The school called an emergency assembly and ordered fellow pupils to treat the individual as female, and threatened tough disciplinary action if he wasn't treated as a girl or if his new name was not used.	1
Sentence	6	Many parents were outraged by the assembly.	1
Sentence	7	One of them stated, "They behaved appallingly by throwing this hand grenade into the room and then leaving the inevitable questions about it for unprepared parents.	0
Sentence	8	Maybe we could have explained sexual politics and encouraged our kids to be more sensitive if we'd had a chance to be involved."	0
Sentence	9	—Deidre Sanders, The Sun	1
Sentence	10	Deidre Sanders, an agony aunt for British tabloid The Sun, which broke the story, gave her view: "It's ironic pupils will be disciplined if they fail to handle this child's sex change 'sensitively' — when their school could hardly have handled it less sensitively.	1
Sentence	11	Breaking news like this in a mass assembly without pre-briefing parents was crass and cruel — and added to this child's troubles."	0
Sentence	12	Because of the tauntings, the boy was absent from school on Thursday.	1
Sentence	13	The family have been receiving threats and the house is now under police protection.	0

Sentence	17	In an interview with Sky News Online, a spokesperson for the Gender Identity Research and Education Society (GIRES) said, "It is very unfortunate [...] It needs a careful process of familiarisation, not the big bang approach.	1
Sentence	18	The proper way would have been to train all staff before the term started, to work with the child's peer group and to prepare the teachers to be able to talk to the other pupils and their parents individually to answer their questions.	0
Sentence	19	What one school did was get the pupil to talk with peers in an interaction that was supervised by teachers.	0
Sentence	20	That kind of careful process is what's required."	0
Sentence	21	Earlier this year, a German born by the name of Tim became Kim Petras after having medication at the age of 12 to suspend her puberty.	1
Sentence	22	She later had feminising hormone treatment and eventually gender confirmation surgery at the age of 16, making her the youngest transsexual in the world.	0
Sentence	23	According to the Sun, this 12 year old boy is preparing to progress with hormone therapy and possibly undergo surgery that would make him one of the world's youngest sex-change patients.	1

Article	380
Sentence	1	Most heroin sold in Europe comes from Afghanistan's poppies.	1
Sentence	2	This past week, the 2005 opium harvest was in full view and going full speed in Afghanistan.	0
Sentence	3	The cultivators gathering resin from the crop are operating even near the main road through Kandahar and the farmers are out gathering resin from opium poppies in full view.	0
Sentence	4	Last year 80% of the world's opium came from Afghanistan and production is up over 239% since 2003, according to U.S. government estimates.	1
Sentence	5	Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of illegal drugs.	0
Sentence	6	In 2002 Super Bowl ads, the White House sent out the message that "drugs fund terrorists".	1
Sentence	7	Doug Wankel, a former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) official, says the opium industry is "financing terrorism.	0
Sentence	8	It's financing subversive activities.	0
Sentence	9	It's financing warlordism... And if it's a threat to the government of Afghanistan, it's a direct threat to the national security interests of the United States."	0
Sentence	10	"The Bush administration has decided not to destroy the opium crop in Afghanistan," stated a U.S. intelligence official returning from Afghanistan in relation to the 60% smaller 2002 crop.	1
Sentence	11	The source, who requested that he not be identified, noted "U.S. forces could destroy the crops using aerial spraying techniques, but no such actions are planned."	0
Sentence	12	U.S. plans to spray the crops were canceled at the request of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who has called for jihad or "holy war", but is concerned that aerial spraying could be harmful to the health of Afghan villagers.	1
Sentence	13	The U.S. claims that the spraying would be safe, but is granting Karzai's request.	0
Sentence	14	Karzai has indicated that he may change his mind if other U.S. strategies fail to halt the opium.	1
Sentence	15	Congress budgeted $774 million for anti-drug operations in Afghanistan just this year.	0
Sentence	16	The CIA reports in From Flowers to Heroin that it takes 10 kg of opium to make 1 kg of 90% pure heroin.	1
Sentence	17	The CIA states that impurities are introduced into the processed heroin before it hits the street, making the purity of the end consumer product about 40%.	0
Sentence	18	That implies that 10 kg of opium makes about 2.25 kg of 40% pure heroin.	0
Sentence	19	The Guardian reports that the 2002 opium harvest was 3400 metric tons.	1
Sentence	20	Using the conversion supplied by the CIA, 2002's 3400 opium harvest could be converted into 765 metric tons of heroin.	0
Sentence	21	According to the International Narcotics Control Board, the 2003 opium harvest was 3600 metric tons.	0
Sentence	22	Using the estimated 239% increase of the present harvast over 2003, it means that the 2005 harvest is about 8600 metric tons.	0
Sentence	23	The 2002 street price of heroin in the UK was about 60 £ per GRAM, or (assuming the present 1.89 USD to 1 £ exchange) 113.40 USD per GRAM.	1
Sentence	24	As the supply goes up the price will come down some, so for this calculation only the 2002 figures will be used.	0
Sentence	25	If all the opium harvest is converted into heroin and all of it is sold at the UK street price, the total street value of the harvest is 86.7 billion USD.	0
Sentence	26	(765 metric tons x 1000 kg/metric ton x 1000 grams/kg x 113.4 USD/gram = about 86.7 billion USD.)	0
Sentence	27	To the extent the 2002 numbers are valid today, the street value of the 2005 harvest should be roughly twice the street value of the 2002 harvest, about 173 billion USD.	0
Sentence	28	To put these numbers in perspective, the total market capitalization of Ford, General Motors and Daimler Chrysler combined is about 76 billion USD.	1
Sentence	29	The total market capitalization of Toyota and Honda combined is about 167 billion USD.	0
Sentence	30	The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was formed to promote harmonization of international antimoney laundering (AML) laws.	1
Sentence	31	Despite the fact that tens of billions of USDs are generated from the Afgan opium harvest alone, the FATF has not added Afghanistan to its blacklist of uncooperative nations.	0
Sentence	32	One has to wonder, therefore, what the poppy farmers are doing with their share of the money that escapes the notice of the banking system and the FATF.	0

Article	235
Sentence	1	Police in Purcell, Oklahoma, about 40 miles (64 km) south of Oklahoma City, on Friday discovered the mutilated body of a ten-year-old girl in the apartment of a man who lived in the same apartment complex.	1
Sentence	2	The body of Jamie Rose Bolin was found in a storage bin in the bedroom closet of Kevin Underwood, 26, said Tim Kuykendall, district attorney for McClain County.	1
Sentence	3	Underwood has been arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder and is being held without bail.	0
Sentence	4	He has no criminal record or history of mental illness.	0
Sentence	5	The girl was last seen on Wednesday near the Purcell public library, and her family reported her missing that night.	1
Sentence	6	Officials waited until Thursday night to issue an Amber Alert because no abduction was reported.	0
Sentence	7	Underwood reportedly drew the suspicion of law enforcement at an information checkpoint set up at the apartment complex.	1
Sentence	8	Among the other items found in Underwood's apartment were a decorative dagger, a hacksaw, barbecue skewers, meat tenderizer, and a wooden cutting board, according to police.	0
Sentence	9	Preliminary autopsy reports find that the girl died of asphyxiation and blunt force trauma to the head.	1
Sentence	10	Deep saw marks found on the body indicate that the suspect attempted to decapitate the girl, say authorities.	0
Sentence	11	As the body was found unclothed, police also suspect that Bolin was molested after she died.	0
Sentence	12	"Regarding a potential motive, this appears to have been part of a plan to kidnap a person, rape them, torture them, kill them, cut off their head, drain the body of blood, rape the corpse, eat the corpse, then dispose of the organs and bones," Purcell police chief David Tompkins said.	1
Sentence	13	According to Kuykendall, Underwood said he began fantasizing about eating someone a year ago.	1
Sentence	14	The prosecutor added that authorities believe "that while she was ultimately chosen to be the victim of this horrific crime, that other people had been targeted and considered," including a woman and a 5-year-old boy.	0
Sentence	15	He added that this was one of the most atrocious crimes he had seen as district attorney, and that he intends to seek the death penalty.	0

Article	46
Sentence	1	Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States have issued an 'urgent safety recommendation' in connection to their role alongside the United Kingdom's Air Accidents Investigation Branch in investigating loss of power in Rolls-Royce engines on Boeing 777s, with the AAIB following suit.	1
Sentence	2	One of them resulted in British Airways Flight 38 crashing short of the runway at London's Heathrow Airport last year.	0
Sentence	3	The NTSB and the AAIB want Rolls-Royce to redesign the engines.	0
Sentence	4	Both events occurred on Boeing 777-200ER airplanes powered by Rolls-Royce RB211 Trent 800 Series engines.	1
Sentence	5	On January 17, 2008 British Airways Flight 38 experienced a dual engine rollback (reduction of engine power) on final approach to Heathrow and crashed, leaving one passenger seriously injured, eight passengers and four of the flight crew with minor injuries and the airplane written off.	0
Sentence	6	The second event occurred on November 26, 2008, when a Delta Air Lines Boeing 777 experienced a single engine rollback during cruise flight over Montana, United States while en route from Shanghai to Atlanta.	1
Sentence	7	Normal operations resumed after the flight crew followed Boeing's published procedure to recover engine performance and the airplane landed safely in Atlanta.	0
Sentence	8	Boeing has already developed new procedures after the crash to prevent ice from building up within their 777 fuel systems after it became apparent that icing may have been a factor, and it was some of these that the Delta flight crew had followed.	1
Sentence	9	Boeing modified these further after the Delta incident.	0
Sentence	10	As part of the recent releases by the NTSB and AAIB it has become apparent that investigators from both bodies, which are collaborating, have found ice buildup in the fuel system caused both rollbacks.	0
Sentence	11	In both cases a build-up of ice (from water normally present in all jet fuel) developed on a component called the fuel/oil heat exchanger.	1
Sentence	12	This restricted the flow of fuel to the engine, resulting in the uncommanded engine rollback.	0
Sentence	13	Investigators initially struggled to produce enough ice under test conditions but have now found that at high concentration, fuel can form ice at very low temperatures in enough quantity to seriously restrict fuel flow, according to a new interim report by the AAIB.	0
Sentence	14	This does not occur when fuel demand is lower, as the hot oil then becomes sufficient to entirely melt the ice.	0
Sentence	15	The British jet experienced very low temperatures over Siberia.	0
Sentence	16	The vigorous tests are thought to be the first of their kind.	1
Sentence	17	They have also confirmed that while ice may have formed elsewhere in the airliner's fuel system fuel was probably not restricted at any other location.	0
Sentence	18	Instead, it is thought 'soft' ice formed in the pipes and then broke off, travelling to the fuel/oil heat exchanger and restricting it.	0
Sentence	19	The NTSB has now revealed that they have advised Rolls-Royce to redesign the fuel/oil heat exchanger, and Rolls-Royce have stated that they are indeed working on a replacement part that will be available within twelve months.	1
Sentence	20	The AAIB advised Boeing and Rolls-Royce to jointly review the problem across the fuel system, and both companies responded that they 'accepted' this recommendation and repeated that a replacement part was being developed.	0
Sentence	21	Both the NTSB and the AAIB also sent letters to the US Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency requesting the installment of the modified component be mandatory.	1
Sentence	22	The NTSB suggested this should be either the next maintenance check or within six months.	0
Sentence	23	There are 220 Boeing 777-200s - the only type using the affected engine - with Trent 800 series engines.	0
Sentence	24	The fuel/oil heat exchanger is a dual purpose part designed to simultaneously melt fuel ice and cool down engine oil.	1
Sentence	25	The AAIB further noted that it is unclear weather other aircraft designs are at risk, and advised the FAA and EASA to look into increased use of de-icing additives and investigate both the accumulation and sudden movement of ice in aircraft fuel systems and the actual formation of ice in the fuel itself.	1

Sentence	2	France looked shaky, making errors throughout and Argentina took the lead early on through penalties from Felipe Contepomi.	1
Sentence	3	Ignacio Corleto scored the only try of the match for Argentina in the 27th minute, but Contepomi missed the conversion, hitting the post.	0
Sentence	4	At half time Argentina led by 17 points to 9, with all France's points coming from penalties scored by David Skrela.	0

Article	136
Sentence	1	Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel gave yesterday's opening address to  the 42nd meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF), which is facing a distinctly different geo-political landscape from twelve months ago.	1
Sentence	2	Outside the WEF security cordon, in the sub-zero temperatures of Davos' train station car park, the local incarnation of the Occupy movement are setting up 'Camp Igloo'; but, with little hope of the archetypes of the 1%, 'Davos Man', arriving by public transport and seeing their sub-zero protest.	0
Sentence	3	David Roth, heading the Swiss centre-left's youth wing — and an organiser of 'Camp Igloo', echoes much of the sentiment from 'Occupy' protests around the world; "[a]t meetings the rest of society is excluded from, this powerful '1 percent' negotiates and decides about the fate of the other 99 percent of this world, [...] economic and financial concentration of power in a small, privileged minority leads to a dictatorship over the rest of us.	1
Sentence	4	The motto 'one person, one vote' is no longer valid, but 'one dollar, one vote'."	0
Sentence	5	Roth's characterisation of 'Davos Man', a term coined by the Professor Samuel Huntington of Harvard University, is more emotive than that of the late professor who saw 'Davos man' as "[having...] little need for national loyalty, view[ing] national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see[ing] national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite's global operations".	1
Sentence	6	As Reuters highlights, many attendees will opt to make their way from Zurich to Davos by private jet, or helicopter, and the WEF itself provides handouts indicating the cost of such is 5,100 Swiss francs (approx.	1
Sentence	7	5,500 USD, 3,500 GBP, 4,200 EUR).	0
Sentence	8	In contrast: travelling by rail, even when opting for first class — without an advance booking, is 145 Swiss francs (approx.	0
Sentence	9	155 USD, 100 GBP).	0
Sentence	10	Shifting fortunes see several past attendees missing this year's exclusive get-together in the alpine resort; for a second year running — and now caught up in the UK phone hacking scandal being scrutinised by Lord Leveson's inquiry — media mogul Rupert Murdoch will not be attending.	1
Sentence	11	Nor will the former head of financial services company UBS Oswald Gruebel, who resigned in the wake of US$2.3 billion losses incurred through unauthorised trading; likewise, Philipp Hildebrand, the ex-head of the Swiss National Bank, is absent following scandal associated with his wife's currency trading activities; and, although the sexual assault charges against Dominique Strauss-Kahn were dropped, having stepped down as managing director of the International Monetary Fund Strauss-Kahn will also be absent.	0
Sentence	12	As the #OccupyWEF protesters were building igloos last weekend, an anti-WEF protest in the Swiss capital Berne was broken up by police, who stated their intent to prosecute participants in the illegal protest.	1
Sentence	13	Allegations of calls for violent protest action led to a high number of officers being involved.	0
Sentence	14	In the aftermath, charges of breach of the peace are to be brought against 153 people, with some targeted for more serious offences.	0
Sentence	15	At least one group involved in the protest described the police response as "disproportionate".	0
Sentence	16	At 'Camp Igloo' Roth says he is seeking discussions with the WEF's expected 2,000 attendees; but his voice, and that of others in the worldwide 'Occupy' movement, is unlikely to be given a platform in the opening debate, "Is 20th-century capitalism failing 21st-century society?"	1
Sentence	17	He, and others taking part in this Swiss incarnation of the 'Occupy' movement, are still considering an invite to a side-session issued by the World Economic Forum's founder, Klaus Schwab; commenting on the invite Roth told the Associated Press they would prefer a debate at a more neutral venue.	0
Sentence	18	As has been the case for several years now, the annual Forum meeting in Davos was preceded with the release of a special report by the World Economic Forum into risks seen as likely to have an impact the in the coming decade.	1
Sentence	19	The 2012 Global Risks Report is a hefty document; the 64-page report is backed with a variety of visualisation tools designed to allow the interrelations between risks to be viewed, how risks interact modelled, and their potential impacts considered — as assessed by the WEF's panel of nearly 500 experts.	0
Sentence	20	As one would expect, economic risks top both the 2012 impact and likelihood charts.	1
Sentence	21	Climate change is pushed somewhat further down the list of concerns likely to drive discussions in Davos.	0
Sentence	22	"Major systemic financial failure" — the collapse of a globally important financial institution, or world currency, is selected as the risk which carries the most potential impact.	0
Sentence	23	However, "Chronic fiscal imbalances" — failing to address excessive government debt, and "Severe income disparity" — a widening of the the gulf between rich and poor, top the list of most likely risks.	1
Sentence	24	At the other end of the tables, disagreeing respectively with the weight last year's Wikinews report gave to orbital debris, and the Motion Picture Association of America's (MPAA) fight with the Internet over copyright legislation, the 2012 Global Risks Report places "Proliferation of Orbital Debris" and "Failure of intellectual property regime" bottom of the league in terms of potential impact.	1
Sentence	25	In 2011, with the current global economic crisis well under-way, "Fiscal crises" topped the WEF risks with the largest potential impact in the next ten years.	1
Sentence	26	However, perceived as most likely a year ago, "Storms and cyclones", "Flooding", and "Biodiversity loss" — all climate-change related points — were placed ahead of "Economic disparity" and "Fiscal crises".	0
Sentence	27	More mundane risks overtake the spectre of terrorism when contrasting this year's report with the 2011 one; volatility in the prices of commodities, consumer goods, and energy, and the security of water supplies are all now ranked as more likely risks than terrorism — though the 2011 report did rank some of these concerns as having a higher potential impact.	1
Sentence	28	A significant shift in perception sees the 2012 report highlight food shortages almost as likely a risk the world will face over the next decade; and, one with a far more significant impact.	0
Sentence	29	Attending the World Economic Forum at Davos is more than just an opportunity to discuss the current state of the global economy, and review the risks which face countries around the world.	1
Sentence	30	With such a high number of political and business leaders in attendance, it is an ideal opportunity to pursue new trade deals.	0
Sentence	31	Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper is, in addition to being a keynote speaker, expected to pursue improved relations with European and Asian trade partners at private meetings on the Forum sidelines.	1
Sentence	32	The Toronto Star reports Harper is likely to push forward an under-negotiation Canadian-European free-trade agreement, and hold closed-door discussions prior to next month's planned trip to China.	0
Sentence	33	Similarly, Canadian trade minister Ed Fast is expected to meet South Korean counterparts to discuss an equivalent deal to the preferential ones between the Asian nation and the US and Europe.	1
Sentence	34	Fast's deal does, however, face opposition at home; the Canadian Auto Workers union asserts that such a deal would put 33,0000 jobs at-risk.	0
Sentence	35	British Prime Minister David Cameron and chancellor George Osborne are expected to discuss a possible increase of UK funding to the International Monetary Fund (IMF); however, with the UK responsible for 4.5% of the US$400 billion in the IMF's lending fund, backbench MPs have warned that committing any additional funds could provoke a Conservative revolt in parliament.	1
Sentence	36	Tuesday's IMF cut of predicted global growth from 4% to 3.3%, warnings of a likely Eurozone recession in 2012, and ongoing problems with Greek financial restructuring, are likely discussion topics at Davos — as well as amongst UK backbench MPs who see adding to the IMF war-chest as bailing out failed European economies.	0
Sentence	37	South Africa, less centre-stage during the 2011 Forum, will be looking to improve relationships and take advantage of their higher profile.	1
Sentence	38	President Jacob Zuma and several cabinet members are attending sessions and discussions; whilst former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown is to moderate a session, "Africa — From Transition to Transformation", with Nigeria, Guinea, and South Sudan's presidents on the panel.	0
Sentence	39	Wal-mart's CEO Doug McMillon is to lead a dinner session, "Shared Opportunities for Africa's Future" — highlighting larger multinationals looking towards the continent for new opportunities.	0
Sentence	40	Davos may also serve as a place to progress disputes out of the public eye; a high-profile dispute between Chile's state-owned copper mining business, Codelco, and Anglo American plc over the 5.39 billion USD sale of a near-quarter stake in their Chilean operations to Japan's Mitsubishi, prompted the Financial Times to speculate that, as the respective company chiefs — Diego Hernández and Cynthia Carroll — are expected to attend, they could privately discuss the spat during the Forum.	1

Sentence	20	That kind of careful process is what's required."	0

Sentence	20	The Black GST group have said "the convergence will be held as a peaceful, family-focussed demonstration against genocide, and for the restoration of sovereignty and the negotiations towards a Treaty."	0
Sentence	21	But the campaign has received flak in mainstream media, such as Melbourne's Herald Sun, who wrote: "the proposal to allow BlackGST to set up an Aboriginal tent embassy at a site well away from the Commonwealth Games will be interpreted by some as the State Government caving in to a radical protest group.	1
Sentence	22	A major concern for the Government... is to protect the event from disruption... no chances should be taken..."	0

Sentence	35	A spokesman for Games Minister Justin Madden said the Government was still investigating other sites.	1
Sentence	36	Victoria Police Games security commander Brendan Bannan said he was not convinced the Black GST represented the views of most indigenous people.	0
Sentence	37	"We are dealing with the Aboriginal community and they don't seem to support it at all … the wider Aboriginal community don't support disruption to the Games at all," he said.	0
Sentence	38	The Government was told that Black GST supporters would camp in Fitzroy Gardens and other city parks should it fail to nominate a site.	1

Sentence	7	The book also describes how some Scientology followers thought that Cruise's wife Katie Holmes was impregnated with frozen sperm from L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology, and Morton compares the situation to Rosemary's Baby "In her more reflective moments, Katie might have felt as if she were in the middle of a real-life version of the horror movie ‘Rosemary’s Baby,’ in which an unsuspecting young woman is impregnated with the devil’s child."	0
Sentence	8	—Church of Scientology	1
Sentence	9	A 15-page statement released by the Church of Scientology denied Morton's assertions of Cruise's No.	1
Sentence	10	2 standing within the organization.	0
Sentence	11	In the statement the Church of Scientology claims that Morton did not respond to requests for an interview "The Church of Scientology requested to be interviewed or be presented with any allegations so we could respond.	0
Sentence	12	Morton refused despite our insistence in offering our cooperation."	0
Sentence	13	The Church of Scientology also specifically responded to the claims regarding Hubbard's frozen sperm: "Was Katie impregnated by L. Ron Hubbard's frozen sperm?	0
Sentence	14	... As distasteful as it is to have to say it, Mr. Hubbard's sperm was never frozen."	0
Sentence	15	According to the AFP, "the Church of Scientology is reportedly considering legal action against US publishers St Martin's Press."	1

Sentence	33	In an interview on The Today Show with Meredith Vieira, Morton defended his work and responded to the statement from the Church of Scientology.	1
Sentence	34	Morton stated that it was unusual for a church to respond in such a way if Cruise is simply an ordinary member, asking "How many churches support one parishioner — a lowly parishioner — that way?"	0

Sentence	38	I formally asked for it.	0
Sentence	39	I was instructed to ask for it by the publisher’s attorneys, and so what they’re saying is nonsense."	0
Sentence	40	Morton explained his motivation for writing the book "He's no longer just an actor or producer, but a powerful advocate for a cult that's out to expand, especially in Europe."	1
Sentence	41	Morton stated that his interest was piqued after Cruise jumped on Oprah's couch during a May 23, 2005 appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, and got into a heated debate with Matt Lauer about his beliefs regarding psychiatry during a June 24, 2005 appearance on The Today Show.	0

Sentence	1	Millions may starve in Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia, and Djibouti in East Africa, because of extreme drought, combined with inequalities built into mechanisms for distributing food, according to the analysis made by Amartya Sen, who was awarded the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998.	1
Sentence	2	War in parts of the region is an extra exacerbating factor.	0
Sentence	3	The countries need immediate food, water, seeds and any other agricultural product, according to the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which reports that millions of people are on the brink of starvation due to the recent severe droughts that have been devastating the area.	1
Sentence	4	"The whole area is affected," FAO representative Shukri Ahmed said.	1
Sentence	5	"The situation is deteriorating."	0
Sentence	6	Local newspaper reports gave an official death toll at 30 famine-related deaths, said Mr Ahmed.	0
Sentence	7	Many had not expected that the area's dry season would be as severe as it has been, and did not anticipate the effects.	1
Sentence	8	Others, such as Yves Engler, expect famines and massive starvation to continue in the region as long as the IMF continues to influence economic policies in the region.	1
Sentence	9	Yves Engler has claimed, consistently with Amartya Sen's analysis, that the IMF is responsible for worsening or actually creating famine in Malawi (2002), Ethiopia (2003) and Niger (2005).	0
Sentence	10	The present drought has been said to be getting worse by the day, and the total figure for those who need food from the World Food Program could rise from today's 1.2 million, to exceed 2.5 million people, according to United Nations (UN) spokesman Stephane Dujarric at the organisation's New York headquarters.	1
Sentence	11	The FAO had called for domestic food purchases in areas where harvests were expected to be favorable, coupled with food aid imports elsewhere, the UN's Mr Dujarric said.	1
Sentence	12	Crops have failed, and local attempts at distributing supplies have been blamed on poor infrastructure and a lack of supplies.	1

Sentence	1	As the World Turns, the longest-running soap opera on American television, was canceled Tuesday by CBS, the network which has aired the show since its first episode in 1956.	1
Sentence	2	This news comes just three months after the ending of Guiding Light, formerly the longest-running soap in radio and television history, which had entertained generations of Americans for seven decades.	0
Sentence	3	In the announcement, Barbara Bloom, senior vice president of daytime programing at CBS, wrote, "It's extremely difficult to say good-bye to a long-running series that's been close to our hearts for so long...The almanacs will show As the World Turns as a pioneer of the format, a hallmark for quality with its numerous Emmys, the launching pad for many television and film stars and a daytime ratings powerhouse for parts of three decades."	1
Sentence	4	The cancellation comes at a particularly bad time not only for the people involved with producing the soap, but also for the soap opera industry in general.	1
Sentence	5	With the cancellation announcement, the number of daytime soap operas on the air in the United States will shrink from seven to six.	0
Sentence	6	By comparison, there were 12 soap operas on the air in 1997 and 19 in 1973.	0
Sentence	7	While the revelation may have hurt, it was not entirely a surprise.	1
Sentence	8	The ratings for the soap opera have fallen to 2.5 million viewers, over 60% from 1993, when the show was watched by 6.5 million viewers daily.	0
Sentence	9	Soap Opera Digest editorial director Lynn Leahey said not to call for the death of the genre; its next act may prove more profitable on the Internet.	0
Sentence	10	"It has to be turned into a business model.	0
Sentence	11	I do think there's huge potential there.	0
Sentence	12	I think if we can deliver the content where people are instead of expecting them to sit in front of their TVs, there's hope," Leahey said.	0
Sentence	13	The news was taken particularly hard at As the World Turns' Brooklyn studios, where the building was closed off to press on Tuesday.	1
Sentence	14	"We are disappointed and saddened by the news that the show is not being renewed.	0
Sentence	15	It will certainly be a loss for all of us, and for the show's loyal audience," said executive producer Christopher Goutman in a prepared statement.	0
Sentence	16	"It's a hell of a Christmas present," said actress Eileen Fulton, whose spitfire character Lisa was an integral part of the canvas in the show's top-rated years in the 1960s and 1970s.	0
Sentence	17	"I'm just very sad.	0
Sentence	18	I'm sad for all of the people who work out there in Brooklyn.	0
Sentence	19	We're a family.	0
Sentence	20	I hate to be split up.	0

Sentence	7	He had gone to Nashville, he said, "to write about the Grand Ole Opry for The New Yorker."	0
Sentence	8	Keillor found Nashville "so unbuttoned.	0
Sentence	9	All of these wonderful performers — Porter Wagoner was there, and Minnie Pearl, Roy Acuff.	0
Sentence	10	They were all children of the Depression, and they felt so lucky to have whatever they had.	0
Sentence	11	And it was really a happy place.	0
Sentence	12	So I got seduced by that into trying to start my own show."	0
Sentence	13	On Friday, Keillor said he kept going for the friendship.	1
Sentence	14	"[I]t was to get to meet people if you had no social skills.	0
Sentence	15	And people would walk up to you and say, 'I heard you on the radio.'	0
Sentence	16	This was the beginning of a conversation that would lead in all sorts of interesting directions."	0
Sentence	17	The final episode changed direction very little; Keillor added duets with five of his favorite singers, then closed the show with a medley he performed alone.	0
Sentence	18	Companion highlighted the sensibilities of the Midwest of Keillor's youth.	1
Sentence	19	His on-air persona was a throwback; a "radio bard" telling amusing stories spun from the fictional town of Lake Wobegon, Minnesota.	0
Sentence	20	Now, he says, that version of the Midwest "is receding in the rear-view mirror at high speed."	0
Sentence	21	Garrison Keillor was one of six children raised in a fundamentalist family in Anoka, Minnesota.	1
Sentence	22	Television was forbidden in the home, but their large Zenith radio allowed him to listen to rhythm and blues music and serials like Lassie.	0
Sentence	23	Keillor began writing after deciding he wanted to play football, only to learn that he had a heart defect.	1
Sentence	24	"So instead of playing football, I wrote about football.	0
Sentence	25	No better thing for a kid, than to write about actual things that are happening before your eyes.	0
Sentence	26	[...] I was very, very lucky."	0
Sentence	27	His broadcasting career started after a speech coach suggested he could overcome his fear of performing in front of other people by taking off his glasses.	0
Sentence	28	"And when you learn that you don't have to be afraid of people you can't see, you've taken a step towards broadcasting, you see?"	0
Sentence	29	42 years later, Keillor says he plans to resume writing.	1
Sentence	30	A memoir and a screenplay are in the works.	0

Sentence	1	Professors at the Energy Science Centre, attached to the Federal Institute of Technology (ETHZ) in Zurich, have presented their contribution of a car quite similar to Loremo able to travel 100 kilometres (around 62 miles) on a tank with just 1 litre (around 1 quart), equalling to about 235 miles per gallon.	1
Sentence	2	They presented their contribution during Swiss Energy Week.	0
Sentence	3	The automobile, which has and will be manufactured by the Swiss company Horlacher, is 75% lighter than an average family car and guzzles a tenth of the fuel thanks to vastly improved aerodynamics.	1
Sentence	4	One drawback to this car is that it has none of the modern safety features found in many cars to-day.	1
Sentence	5	But the FIT team is designing technology that lets cars communicate with each other to avoid collisions, using similar computer systems to those in aircraft.	0
Sentence	6	"This car does compromise on style, speed and comfort, but you can't have a free lunch," says Lino Guzzella, one of the centre's members	1

Sentence	12	According to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, the main lobbying group of the automobile industry in the European Union, the average car in Switzerland has a 2 litre engine compared with 1.6 litres in neighbouring countries.	0
Sentence	13	"The Swiss think they are better at cutting harmful emissions than anyone else, but they are not," says researcher Peter de Haan van der Weg.	1
Sentence	14	He believes Switzerland should introduce incentives to make people buy cleaner cars.	1
Sentence	15	Some countries already have such schemes: the US awards tax breaks worth up to $3,000 and the Netherlands offers €6,000 to green car owners.	0
Sentence	16	The Swiss authorities are currently thinking about two similar options presented by the city of Bern and the centre-left Social Democratic Party.	0
Sentence	17	"Individuals are not capable of understanding the big picture because it is difficult for people to look 50 years into the future," Mr. De Haan van der Weg said.	1

Article	214
Sentence	1	A jury last week cleared four officers from London's Metropolitan Police of assaulting a Muslim arrested on suspicion of al-Qaeda involvement.	1
Sentence	2	After trial their lawyer described the charge as "unfounded and unsubstantiated" – but in 2009 the police said Babar Ahmed, 34, had suffered "a serious, gratuitous and prolonged" assault.	0
Sentence	3	Ahmed has been previously paid £60,000 in a civil case, which the jury was unaware of.	1
Sentence	4	After one hour of deliberations, they acquited Pc Roderick James-Bowen, 40; Pc Mark Jones, 43; Pc Nigel Cowley, 34; and Detective Constable John Donohue, 37, of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.	0
Sentence	5	The four officers claimed at trial that Ahmed's wounds were either self-inflicted or caused during legal restraint during his December 2003 capture.	1
Sentence	6	They said he had fought hard against arrest.	0
Sentence	7	The prosecutor contended the four officers, from the specialist Territorial Support Group, "punched and [beat Ahmed] on the floor," calling him a "fucking bastard" and a "fucking cunt."	0
Sentence	8	"On the floor the assault continued as his wife called out for the police to stop," Jonathan Laidlaw, prosecuting, told the jury.	1
Sentence	9	This was followed, he claimed, by a visit to Ahmed's prayer room, where he was positioned as if praying and asked "Where is your god now?	0
Sentence	10	Pray to him."	0
Sentence	11	The prosecution alleged further abuse against Ahmed in a police van en route to the police station, with Ahmed saying at Charing Cross police station he was attacked again in an area not covered by CCTV surveillance.	1
Sentence	12	He was left, in the words of Laidlaw, with "areas of bruising, reddening and grazes to [his] head and neck, bruising to the chest, areas of bruising to [his] back, extensive bruising and grazing of the arms.	0
Sentence	13	In effect, there were injuries all over the victim's body."	0
Sentence	14	The defence noted that MI5 bugged Ahmed's house and a recording of the arrest failed to show elements of the alleged attack.	1
Sentence	15	James-Bowen told the court of a "ferocious" fight with Ahmed, who used "significant force."	0
Sentence	16	Jones told the jury his superiors had informed him Ahmed had been trained in both armed and unarmed fighting.	0
Sentence	17	Less than a year earlier, a similar operation in Manchester resulted in an officer stabbed to death by a suspect now serving life in prison.	1
Sentence	18	The four officers dealing with Ahmed had been warned their suspect posed a similar threat.	0
Sentence	19	Speaking outside court, their solicitor, Colin Reynolds said the men were now able to "[get] on with their professional lives" following the dismissal by the jury of "unfounded and unsubstantiated allegations."	1
Sentence	20	Local media had been barred during trial from reporting that, between the two of them, Jones and James-Bowen had been accused of a total 40 assaults from 1993 to 2007, all of which have been rejected.	0
Sentence	21	Jones was previously tried for assaulting two teens in the back of a police van and yelling racist abuse at them, but was cleared.	0
Sentence	22	Fiona Murphy, who represents Ahmed, was critical of the Independent Police Complaints Commission.	1
Sentence	23	"We now call upon the IPCC to put its abject failures in relation to this case to one side and to give proper consideration to the misconduct aspects."	0
Sentence	24	Ahmed released a statement, saying, "Today's verdict means that no police officer has been held to account for this abuse.	0
Sentence	25	Therefore I urge the Metropolitan police to bring disciplinary proceedings against all officers who were personally involved in the assault – and those who turned a blind eye."	0
Sentence	26	His father read it out at a post-trial press conference.	0
Sentence	27	Ahmed was never charged, but was re-arrested in 2004 and has spent the last seven years in custody facing extradition to the US.	1
Sentence	28	The US seeks to try him for fundraising for militancy amid claims he is a member of al-Qaeda; though initially a ruling in favour of extradition was reached an appeal is pending.	0
Sentence	29	Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC, who oversaw the trial, expressed support for Ahmed's position detained without trial: "I express the hope that his ordeal as a man in detention in this country for a number of years without trial is brought to an end as soon as possible, either by his extradition or by his release.	1
Sentence	30	It is no concern of this court as to which, but it is a matter of concern and I would have thought should be a matter of concern to the public at large, quite apart from Mr Ahmed, that here is a man who has been in custody for literally years without knowing what his fate is to be."	0

Sentence	1	After two weekends of box office domination, Universal Pictures' Meet the Fockers will be challenged for the top spot by horror film White Noise, also from Universal, which opens in wide release Friday.	1
Sentence	2	To be considered in wide release, a film must open or play in at least 1,000 theatres throughout the U.S. and Canada.	1
Sentence	3	With Noise being the only new wide release movie for the weekend, it looks to take advantage of movie goers looking from a change from holiday themed film fare.	0

Sentence	5	But according to one critic, this film may not be a comeback hit for Keaton.	0

Sentence	8	Garner's not alone in panning the film.	0
Sentence	9	According to web site RottenTomatoes.com, 87 percent of film critics in its survey have given the film a bad review.	0

Sentence	11	But not all reviews were bad.	1
Sentence	12	Hollywood Reporter critic, Kirk Honeycutt said, "Even though logic takes a holiday in White Noise, Geoffrey Sax, a British television director making his theatrical debut, lavishes enough craft on the paranormal thriller to send more than a few chills down the spine."	0
Sentence	13	The movie faces stiff competition as five other films have a wider release, playing in more theatres and reaching a larger potential audience.	1

Sentence	1	Commander Ali Dizaei of London's Metropolitan Police Service today became the most senior officer anywhere in the United Kingdom to be convicted of offences by a court.	1
Sentence	2	Dizaei, who was branded a "criminal in uniform" by Independent Police Complaints Commission chair Nick Hardwick, has been jailed for four years after he attempted to frame an Iraqi businessman.	0
Sentence	3	It took a Southwark Crown Court jury under three hours to find Dizaei guilty of misconduct in a public office and attempting to pervert the course of justice.	1
Sentence	4	The charges carried a maximum of life imprisonment.	0
Sentence	5	Dizaei, 47, who is head of the National Black Police Association, had gone to the Yas Persian restaurant, run by one of his friends, and taken his wife Shy with him.	1
Sentence	6	They then went to their car and struck up a conversation through its open window with the restaurant's manager.	0
Sentence	7	During this conversation they were approached by Waad al-Baghdadi, an Iraqi website designer in his twenties.	0
Sentence	8	He requested that Dizaei pay £600 that he owed Baghdadi, who had constructed his website.	0
Sentence	9	According to the Crown, this dispute had been ongoing for months and Dizaei had been attempting to intimidate Baghdadi.	1
Sentence	10	He told the Iraqi to depart when he entered the restaurant; although the businessman did, he stayed nearby and rang the 999 emergency number.	0
Sentence	11	The exact content of the argument that led up to this is unclear.	1
Sentence	12	Dizaei and his wife testified that Baghdadi was abusive and threatening, telling the officer he would "extract the money out of your throat" while the owner of the Yas said he was "a crook basically... His history ... everybody knows he's not a good gentleman," said owner Sohrab Eshragi.	0
Sentence	13	Eshragi said that the request Baghdadi leave the premises was due to concerns of trouble, claiming Baghdadi had been in a previous fight.	0
Sentence	14	Baghdadi denied the allegations and the court rejected Dizaei's version of events.	0
Sentence	15	—Restaurant owner's description of the man arrested by Dizaei	1
Sentence	16	While Baghdadi was making his emergency call, Dizaei arrested him and made a 999 call of his own.	1
Sentence	17	He requested assistence from other officers, and said that Baghdadi had assaulted him by stabbing his stomach with a shisha pipe.	0
Sentence	18	He maintained this account when police arrived and kept it up in written statements, but although Baghdadi was found to be carrying such a pipe examination of Dizaei's wounds by a police doctor concluded he had inflicted them upon himself.	0

Sentence	22	The Crown further alleged that Dizaei told Baghdadi "I'll fuck your life... You think I don't know what you do in London...	1
Sentence	23	I'll find every single detail of your life in London."	0
Sentence	24	The prosecution case was presented by Peter Wright QC, who has prosecuted in trials over serial murders of Suffolk sex workers and a plot to bomb transatlantic airliners.	0
Sentence	25	He said that Dizaei's actions were a "wholesale abuse of power by a senior police officer for entirely personal and oblique motives."	0
Sentence	26	Judge Justice Simon said that Dizaei had committed a "grave breach of public trust" and told him "This sentence needs to send a clear message that police officers of whatever rank are not above the law."	1
Sentence	27	A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said outside the court that "He abused his power and ignored his responsibility," and that while corruption was unacceptable in any police officer it was particularly so in a senior member of the forces.	0
Sentence	28	"The public should have confidence that we will prosecute anyone, regardless of their position, if they commit serious offences.	0
Sentence	29	We believe justice has been served for the victim and the public."	0
Sentence	30	—Nick Hardwick of the Independant Police Complaints Commission	1
Sentence	31	"[I]f he [Dizaei] had been successful, Mr al-Baghdadi may have been sent to prison," noted Hardwick.	1
Sentence	32	"Mr al-Baghdadi has shown tremendous strength of character throughout this case ‑ from the moment he was confronted by Ali Dizaei, throughout our investigation, and finally when giving evidence at court.	0
Sentence	33	We are grateful for the confidence he placed in the IPCC and, as a result of that, justice has been done today."	0
Sentence	34	Dizaei has been a policeman for 24 years, and at one stage was rumoured to be destined to take control of the Metropolitan Police, although the Metropolitan Police Authority may now choose to end this career.	1
Sentence	35	His trial, which began this month, is his second this decade.	0
Sentence	36	He was prosecuted in 2003 but cleared of any wrongdoing.	0
Sentence	37	The incident with Baghdadi was in June 2008 and Dizaei has been suspended on full pay since September of that year.	0
Sentence	38	Hardwick said that "The greatest threat to the reputation of the police service is criminals in uniform like Dizaei."	0

Article	153
Sentence	1	Thirty-six years after he was found guilty of an armed robbery in London, a court has quashed the conviction of George Davis, ruling it unsafe.	1
Sentence	2	The court stopped short of ruling he was definitely innocent, leaving a prominent 1970s campaign that saw "George Davis is innocent - OK" graffiti daubed across the city only partially vindicated.	0

Sentence	11	By 1977, however, Davis was back in prison and admitted a role in a different armed robbery, at a Bank of Cyprus branch.	0
Sentence	12	"I have been protesting my innocence since 1974," Davis said yesterday.	1
Sentence	13	Lawyers have said evidence that should have overturned the 1975 conviction "had been in the hands of the authorities since 1977."	0
Sentence	14	Following the conviction the case was reviewed by Detective Chief Superintendent Jack Moulder from Hertfordshire Police, who reported back to the Home Office in 1977.	1
Sentence	15	Journalist Andy McSmith, writing in The Independent, claims the result "was so damning that for 34 years the Home Office refused to let anyone, including Davis's lawyers, see it."	0
Sentence	16	Moulder's report drew on evidence from Inspector Brian Reynolds, who began the investigation into the robbery before responsibility was passed to the specialist Robbery Squad.	1
Sentence	17	Reynolds had criticisms of the Robbery Squad, but said senior officers warned him not to obstruct Davis's conviction in any way.	0
Sentence	18	The Robbery Squad was being led by Jack Slipper, whose claim to fame is that he tracked down the Great Train Robbers.	0
Sentence	19	The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates alleged miscarriages of justice, collected evidence in the Davis case and referred it back to the Court of Appeal.	1
Sentence	20	36 years ago, a young barrister called David Whitehouse defended Davis.	0
Sentence	21	Yesterday, Whitehouse's last day in court before retiring was in the Court of Appeal, hearing Davis's conviction overturned.	0
Sentence	22	"If George Davis had not been so stupid as to rob a bank I might have got the conviction quashed [in the 70s]," he remarked outside court.	1
Sentence	23	Asked about being called stupid, Davis remarked "He can call me what he likes after [all] he's done for me."	0
Sentence	24	The appeal was heard by a panel of three judges.	1
Sentence	25	Lord Justice Hughes said they were in a "state of ignorance whether or not the defendant committed this robbery and we are unable positively to exonerate him".	0
Sentence	26	"We do not know whether Davis was guilty or not, but his conviction cannot be said to be safe," Hughes concluded.	0
Sentence	27	"I have pursued this appeal for all these years because I wanted all those people who worked for, and helped, the campaign in the 1970s to know that their support was justified," Davis said.	1

Sentence	5	The statement, written after criticism in the press of the U.S. military’s lack of precaution in these matters, then went on to say the U.S. armed forces “regret the loss of innocent lives and follow stringent rules of engagement specifically to ensure that non-combatants are safeguarded.	1

Sentence	5	The scientology.org site was back online briefly on Monday, and is currently loading slowly.	0
Sentence	6	On Monday, the group released a video titled: "Message to Scientology" on YouTube concerning their intentions to attack the Church of Scientology.	1
Sentence	7	A robotic voice on the video begins with "Hello leaders of Scientology.	0
Sentence	8	We are Anonymous," and continues by explaining their motivations: "Over the years we have been watching you, your campaigns of misinformation, your suppression of dissent and your litigious nature.	0
Sentence	9	All of these things have caught our eye.	0
Sentence	10	With the leakage of your latest propaganda video into mainstream circulation the extent of your malign influence over those who have come to trust you as leaders has been made clear to us.	0
Sentence	11	Anonymous has therefore decided that your organisation should be destroyed."	0
Sentence	12	The message goes on to state that the group intends to "expel Scientology from the Internet".	0

Sentence	18	Blogging for Wired magazine, Ryan Singel wrote about the incident in a piece on Wednesay titled "War Breaks Out Between Hackers and Scientology -- There Can Be Only One".	0
Sentence	19	Singel wrote that the Project Chanology wiki page "directs Anonymous members to download and use denial of service software, make prank calls, host Scientology documents the Church considers proprietary, and fax endless loops of black pages to the Church's fax machines to waste ink".	0
Sentence	20	According to Wired, "The Church of Scientology did not immediately respond to a call for comment".	0
Sentence	21	The viewpoints expressed in the video are echoed on the "Project Chanology" website, an open source of information and direction for those within Anonymous, which talks of tactics such as blackfaxing and prank calling alongside other "real-life" methods of attack.	1
Sentence	22	The satirical website Encyclopedia Dramatica also has a similar page devoted to "Project Chanology".	0
Sentence	23	—"Anonymous" - Press Release	1
Sentence	24	"Anonymous" released a statement on Monday in the form of a press release, "Internet Group Anonymous Declares "War on Scientology": "Anonymous" are fighting the Church of Scientology and the Religious Technology Center".	1
Sentence	25	In the statement, the group explained their goal as safeguarding the right to freedom of speech "A spokesperson said that the group's goals include bringing an end to the financial exploitation of Church members and protecting the right to free speech, a right which they claim was consistently violated by the Church of Scientology in pursuit of its opponents."	0
Sentence	26	The press release also claimed that the Church of Scientology misused copyright and trademark law in order to remove criticism from websites including Digg and YouTube.	0
Sentence	27	The statement goes on to assert that the attacks from the group "will continue until the Church of Scientology reacts, at which point they will change strategy".	0

Sentence	29	After the Church of Scientology lodged a copyright infringement complaint with YouTube, the site took down the video.	0

Sentence	33	Gawker.com briefly outlined actions of other anonymous users critical of Scientology, including actions taken in the past by users of YouTube, Digg, and YTMND "This isn't the only group of Internet users unafraid of the intimidating cult; a whole range of sites has turned the Church into a mockery by doing what mainstream celebrity-coverage outlets wouldn't dare."	0

Sentence	37	", and "spam our newsgroup to this day".	0
Sentence	38	In 1999 "sporgery", a form of nonsensical spam tactic, was used as an attempt to disrupt discussion on the newsgroup.	0

Sentence	40	group from Usenet.	0

Sentence	43	This initial conflict came to be known as "Scientology versus the Internet".	0
Sentence	44	The post from Jacobsen went on to criticize the actions of the "Anonymous" group, stating: "We're supposed to be the good people," and stated that contrary to the Anonymous group's tactics, "Our weapons as critics are reason, evidence, argument, and free speech".	1
Sentence	45	—Andreas Heldal-Lund, Operation Clambake	1
Sentence	46	On Tuesday, the founder of Operation Clambake, a non-profit organization and website critical of Scientology based in Stavanger, Norway, released a statement about the attacks by "Anonymous".	1
Sentence	47	Andreas Heldal-Lund was critical of the "Anonymous" groups actions, stating: "The author of Operation Clambake does not condone such activity.	0
Sentence	48	Attacking Scientology like that will just make them play the religious persecution card.	0
Sentence	49	They will use it to defend their own counter actions when they try to shatter criticism and crush critics without mercy."	0
Sentence	50	Heldal-Lund went on to emphasize the right of all people and organizations to freedom of speech - including the Church of Scientology: "Freedom of speech means we need to allow all to speak - including those we strongly disagree with.	0
Sentence	51	I am of the opinion that the Church of Scientology is a criminal organisation and a cult which is designed by its delusional founder to abuse people.	0
Sentence	52	I am still committed to fight for their right to speak their opinion."	0

Sentence	9	It was later made famous by the communist Mao Zedong during his reign as the leader of China.	0
Sentence	10	One Mao suit owner remembers purchasing what for him was a very expensive version of the suit when it was more popular several decades ago.	1

Sentence	1	After the United States agreed to the changes proposed by India this morning, the so called Bali Roadmap has been agreed on, to applause from all parties.	1
Sentence	2	The decision was made at this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali.	0
Sentence	3	The Roadmap establishes a time frame and scope for reaching a post-2012 climate change agreement.	0
Sentence	4	This includes setting, for industrialized nations, targets for reductions of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.	0
Sentence	5	Numerous observers and parties had voiced that they see this as being of great importance prior to and during the conference.	0
Sentence	6	Following the reopening of the plenary at midday, India reiterated its position that part of a paragraph needed to be reformulated.	1
Sentence	7	The EU went on to state that in the spirit of negotiations, they agreed with the proposed changes.	0
Sentence	8	After some further statements by other nations, the US said that they can not accept the changes, as they would considerably change the balance of the text.	0
Sentence	9	This was met with loudly audible booing in the plenary.	0
Sentence	10	Some time later, after a number of other nations voiced their opinions and the American delegation could be seen busily debating and writing, the US said they would agree to the consensus position after all.	0
Sentence	11	Standing ovations and cheers welcomed this change in position, which allowed the President of the Conference soon thereafter to declare the document decided.	0
Sentence	12	India this morning had raised objections on one of the central documents of what constitutes the Roadmap.	1
Sentence	13	This had made a decision impossible for the time being, as the conference can only pass items unanimously.	0

Sentence	18	China then accused the UNFCCC secretariat of deliberately opening the plenary session at a time it knew that their Ministers were in talks.	0
Sentence	19	The Chinese delegate went on to demand an apology by the secretariat, and the meeting was again suspended.	0
Sentence	20	Ministerial negotiations had continued through the night until the early morning hours yesterday and the climate conference had been scheduled to decide on the last outstanding items this morning.	1
Sentence	21	Yesterday evening Yvo de Boer of the UNFCCC had said that the parties were "on the brink of agreement", when he was asked where negotiations currently stand.	1
Sentence	22	With almost all open matters having been agreed on by a group of 40 ministers, one of the last outstanding points then was still the question of guideline numbers for GHG cuts.	0
Sentence	23	Some of the issues that had still been open the day before yesterday (for example how deforestation was to be addressed and the matter of financial support for developing countries to send and support negotiators to the UN climate conferences), had apparently been addressed to everyones satisfaction during yesterdays informal talks.	1
Sentence	24	But the talks were still on with regard to preambular text of a document that states how further action to mitigate climate change is to be taken, the inclusion of a 25-40% range for reductions in GHG emissions for industrialized nations by 2020 from 1990 levels being contested.	0
Sentence	25	The draft decision proposed by the President of the Conference today however, no longer included the numbers, but did make reference to the latest report by the international body of scientists that is charged with assessing the current state of knowledge on climate change.	1

Sentence	1	Corus Group, the world's fifth largest steel producer, announced on Friday that it may be forced to mothball its steelworks in Redcar, England.	1
Sentence	2	This move would threaten the jobs of the works' 1,920 employees.	0
Sentence	3	Corus may be forced to close its Teesside operations as a consortium has refused to honour a 10-year contract with Corus' Teesside Cast Products, which accounted for 78% of the plant's operations.	1
Sentence	4	Corus' chief executive, Kirby Adams, said he was "extremely disappointed that the consortium members have seen fit to take this irresponsible action."	0
Sentence	5	Lord Mandelson, Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, said "it is essential that Corus does everything it can legally, and with the government's assistance, to reinstate the agreement".	1
Sentence	6	Gordon Brown, the British Prime Minister, shared this view saying, "We are doing everything in our power to ensure that the contract is upheld."	0
Sentence	7	Mandelson also said "we are not prepared to reconcile ourselves to the inevitable closure of this plant".	0

Sentence	10	Hughes and Fiona Hall, Lib Dem MEP, suggested that the government should apply to the EU's Globalisation Adjustment Fund.	0
Sentence	11	Hall said "if the worst comes to the worst and jobs are indeed lost, I trust the Government will change its mind and support an application to the European Globalisation Fund in order to fund skills training for those who have lost their jobs."	0
Sentence	12	This move could "bring to an end a fine heritage of steelmaking at Teesside", according to Adams.	1
Sentence	13	Steelworks in Teesside, which previously belonged to British Steel and Dorman Long, produced steel for famous structures like the Sydney Harbour Bridge.	0

Sentence	1	Access to the Russian-language Wikipedia is disabled across almost all its pages today, due to the Russian parliament, the Duma, debating amendments to the law "About information" which may lead to censorship of Runet through blacklisting and filtering of internet sites.	1
Sentence	2	The proposed bill aims to creating a blacklist of internet sites alleged to host child pornography, drug related material, extremist material and other content illegal in the country.	1
Sentence	3	It also proposed several other changes in the law, including holding providers of telecommunication services liable for failing to protect children.	0
Sentence	4	Critics, including Google, Yahoo, search engine Yandex and social networking site Vkontakte noted that as-written the legislation contained many technical faults likely to negatively impact legitimate internet use.	1
Sentence	5	In protest, the Russian Wikipedia community decided upon a near-total blackout of contents on July 10.	0
Sentence	6	The blackout banner includes the text: "Imagine a world without free knowledge", and summarises the details of the bill.	0
Sentence	7	Readers are warned that articles, such as Suicide, may be considered "harmful" due to ambiguity in the proposed legislation, risking a block of the entire website by Russia-based Internet providers.	0
Sentence	8	Later in the day, the popular blogging platform LiveJournal issued a statement similarly opposed to the legislation: "[...Livejournal] considers the introduction of any restrictions on freedom of expression and information in the Internet to be unacceptable."	1
Sentence	9	The announcement by the Russian Wikimedia community states:	1
Sentence	10	Supporters of the law proposed say that it is aimed only at widely prohibited content such as child pornography and «information like this», but conditions for determining the content falling under this law will create a thing like the «great Chinese firewall».	1
Sentence	11	The existing Russian law's practice shows the high possibility of the worst scenario, in which access to Wikipedia soon will be closed in the country.	0
Sentence	12	On July 11 the second reading of the law in the State Duma will take place.	1
Sentence	13	The law will come into force after the third reading, for which a date has not yet been set.	0
Sentence	14	In January, the English-language Wikipedia ran a similar 'blackout protest' for 24 hours, protesting US anti-piracy laws the Stop Online Piracy Act and PROTECT IP Act (PIPA).	1
Sentence	15	That action resulted in those laws being reconsidered.	0
Sentence	16	An earlier blackout, in October last year, saw the Italian Wikipedia community successfully oppose other Internet censorship legislation.	0
Sentence	17	Speaking to Wikinews in January, the Wikimedia Foundation's chief executive, Sue Gardner, explained "[t]he Wikimedia movement does not have a lot of experience with advocacy, and probably mistakes will get made.	1
Sentence	18	At this time the Wikimedia Foundation doesn't have any plans to develop policy governing protests or advocacy work.	0
Sentence	19	But, I think it probably does make sense for the Foundation to create venues for these discussions".	0

Sentence	11	"A series of low pressure centers have brought ice and snow from the Rockies, Southern Plains, to the Midwest and portions of the Northeast.	1
Sentence	12	Several additional disturbances and the presence of shallow Arctic air will continue to bring bouts of freezing rain, sleet, and snow from the Southwest to the Plains States, Midwest, and Northeast over the next several days," said a statement on the NWS's website.	0

Sentence	1	United States Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano has announced that the US Government has ended funding for a controversial "virtual fence" along the US-Mexico border.	1
Sentence	2	—Part of a statement from Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano	1
Sentence	3	The program, called  SBInet, will have $50 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 that was allocated to it withdrawn in favor of investment in other, immediately available technology for the purposes of security along the border.	1
Sentence	4	The program will also have all further funding immediately frozen; as a result, all work will halt on the project beyond two small test projects in Arizona.	0
Sentence	5	Officially, the move is in light of a pending reassessment of the program, though it is likely that it signals the end of the five-year project, which has come under mounting criticism based on cost and the time taken to complete the project.	0
Sentence	6	In a statement, Napolitano said that, "effective immediately, the Department of Homeland Security will redeploy $50 million of Recovery Act funding originally allocated for the SBInet...to other tested, commercially available security technology along the Southwest border."	1
Sentence	7	Criticism of the project has been largely based on the cost, which has been commented on by several government officials, including Senator John McCain, who criticized the program as "spending over $1 billion of taxpayers' dollars on a failed system of sensors and cameras."	1
Sentence	8	According to statements released last year, at the beginning of construction, the project would cost a total of $6.7 billion, of which $3.4 billion has been spent on the first phase of the plan.	0
Sentence	9	The shortcomings were acknowledged by Napolitano in her statement, which said that "the system of sensors and cameras along the Southwest border known as SBInet has been plagued with cost overruns and missed deadlines."	0
Sentence	10	The project was originally introduced in 2006 by President George W. Bush, and was envisioned as a high-tech system, dubbed a "virtual fence," that combined cameras, radar, and sensors to allow the Border Patrol to intercept up to 85% of incursions with as few as 22,000 officers.	1
Sentence	11	The contract was awarded to Boeing, which has since come under criticism for developing costly new technologies rather than using off-the-shelf systems.	0
Sentence	12	Under Barack Obama, the government initially continued to support the program, and laid out a new timetable for the its completion.	0
Sentence	13	Last month, however, under questioning from Congress about the program's viability, the administration reduced funding to complete the first phase by 30%, to $574 million.	0

Sentence	2	But Universal's dominance of the North American box office receipts is in danger as 20th Century Fox, Paramount, Warner Brothers and Sony all have films debuting in wide release Friday.	1

Sentence	2	"My preference obviously would be to capture or kill him," said Mr Obama yesterday.	1

Sentence	10	In a recent audio tape attributed to bin Laden, the al-Qaeda leader promised the president-elect that al-Qaeda would open new fronts against the USA.	1
Sentence	11	"The worst heritage is when a man inherits a long guerrilla warfare with a persevering, patient enemy - a war that is funded by usury.	0

Sentence	1	In November 2006 Pensacola, Florida evangelist Kent Hovind and his wife, Jo, were found guilty on 58 federal counts of "willful failure" to payroll taxes, structuring bank withdrawals, and obstructing federal agents.	1
Sentence	2	On January 19, 2007 Hovind was given ten years in federal prison, ordered to pay $640,000 in owed funds to the Internal Revenue Service, pay prosecution's court costs of $7,078, and serve three years parole once released.	0
Sentence	3	Originally in November, Hovind was ordered to forfeit $430,400 and faced a maximum of 288 years in prison.	0
Sentence	4	Hovind, self-styled as  "Dr. Dino" (whose Ph.D, from a non-accredited correspondence university, is in Christian education) believes in Biblical literalism claimed that he is not liable for taxes and his "ministry" does not have to "render unto Caesar" because, as he claimed, his workers are "missionaries" not "employees".	1
Sentence	5	Hovind's tax troubles date back to at least 1996, when a judge at Hovind's bankruptcy trial wrote, Hovind "failed to acknowledge his obligations as a citizen and taxpayer of the United States, seeks to utilize this taxpayer supported court in order to thwart the lawful collection efforts of the Internal Revenue Service."	1
Sentence	6	The judge concluded, Hovind filed for bankruptcy in "bad faith," and lied about his possessions and income.	0
Sentence	7	In the April 2004 raid on his "ministry" business records were taken, and according to an IRS agent "since 1997, Hovind has engaged in financial transactions indicating sources of income and has made deposits to bank accounts well in excess of $1 million per year during some of these years."	1
Sentence	8	During a IRS raid in Spring 2006, the government confiscated records, $42,000 in cash was seized, and that day Kent Hovind withdrew $70,000 from the Creation Science Evangelism account, half in a check; the other in cash.	1
Sentence	9	At the November trial, the young Earth creationist chose not to present a defense case.	1
Sentence	10	While the prosecution noted Hovind never filed income taxes with the government, others testified Hovind claimed he had "beat" the tax system, and employees said Hovind's evangelism was a business not a ministry.	0
Sentence	11	Hovind was found guilty in November 2006 by twelve jurors at the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida in Pensacola.	1
Sentence	12	The charges included twelve counts of willful failure to collect, account for, and pay over Federal income taxes and FICA taxes under 26 U.S.C.	0
Sentence	13	§ 7202, forty-five counts of knowingly structuring transactions in Federally-insured financial institutions to evade the reporting requirements of 31 U.S.C.	0

Sentence	17	sec.	0
Sentence	18	103.11, and one count of corruptly endeavoring to obstruct and impede the administration of the internal revenue laws under 26 U.S.C.	0
Sentence	19	§ 7212.	0
Sentence	20	The sentencing on Friday January 19, 2007 was a lengthy exchange that lasted 5 1/2 hours, and included statements from Hovind and his family members.	1
Sentence	21	During the sentencing a recording of telephone conversations Hovind made from jail was played in court.	1
Sentence	22	In those conversations Hovind said the Internal Revenue Service, presiding judge and prosecutor broke the law by going after him, and there were things he could do "to make their lives miserable."	0
Sentence	23	In other recordings played Hovind was trying to hide assets from the government.	0
Sentence	24	One conversation with Eric Hovind, Kent Hovind's son, showed the two conspire to put assets in other peoples names and "loan" a motorhome with intent to have it returned.	0
Sentence	25	This was in violation of a court order, which allows property to be seized in restitution of owed money.	0
Sentence	26	In court, however, "My father is not a man who is in love with money.	0
Sentence	27	He's in love with God," Eric told the judge.	0
Sentence	28	In another jailhouse phone conversation Hovind spoke with an unidentified man, and he agreed with Hovind on hiding 10% of Hovind's merchandise and master DVDs from the government.	1
Sentence	29	Hovind then proposed a new shipping location out of the reach of the government to continue to sell merchandise despite a court order to pay debt or surrender his assets.	0

Sentence	1	 The definition of what is and what is not a planet is being challenged by a newly announced discovery Friday.	1
Sentence	2	Astronomers from the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, California said they found a chunk of ice and rock in the solar system larger than Pluto.	0
Sentence	3	The object, given the temporary generic name of 2003 UB313, is about 9 billion miles away from the sun.	1
Sentence	4	It was first photographed in 2003 using the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii.	0
Sentence	5	But it was an indistinguishable bright spot among a field of stars in an area of the sky where astronomers don't usually look at for planets or planet-type objects.	0
Sentence	6	Solar system bodies found beyond the orbit of Neptune are called "trans-Neptunian objects".	1
Sentence	7	One of them, Pluto, is also classified as a planet.	0
Sentence	8	Up until now all other planet-like discoveries beyond Neptune, including Sedna, found by the same Palomar team in 2004, are called Kuiper Belt objects, or minor planets.	0
Sentence	9	Using a photo taken on January 8, the Palomar team compared it with previous 2003 UB313 photos to triangulate the object's distance, brightness and orbit.	1
Sentence	10	Using mathematical formulas, they found a range of sizes for 2003 UB313, with an estimated average showing the approximate diameter of the new body to be about 2,600 kilometers.	1
Sentence	11	But even at the smallest estimate scientists are certain 2003 UB313 is larger than Pluto's 2,250 kilometer diameter.	0
Sentence	12	To determine size, Scientists deduce the relative size of a solar system object by its brightness, just as one can infer the size of a faraway light bulb if one knows its wattage.	1
Sentence	13	The reflectance of 2003 UB313 is not yet known for sure.	0
Sentence	14	Scientists can not yet tell how much light from the sun is reflected away from its surface, but the amount of light the planet does reflect puts a lower limit on its size.	0
Sentence	15	"Even if it reflected 100 percent of the light reaching it, it would still be as big as Pluto," Michael E. Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology said in a NASA press release.	1
Sentence	16	"I'd say it's probably one and a half times the size of Pluto, but we're not sure yet of the final size."	0
Sentence	17	"We are 100 percent confident that this is the first object bigger than Pluto ever found in the outer solar system," Brown added.	1
Sentence	18	The object is inclined by a whopping 45 degrees to the main plane of the solar system, where most of the other planets orbit.	1
Sentence	19	That's why it eluded discovery: nobody was looking there until now, Brown said.	0
Sentence	20	Most objects in the solar system are just a few degrees from the main plane of the solar system, called the Ecliptic.	1
Sentence	21	Pluto, which is considered substantially different from the rest of the planets, is only 17 degrees from this main plane.	0
Sentence	22	Astronomers who study the sky for asteroids and comets usually look in the region of the sky that the rest of the planets occupy.	0
Sentence	23	The brightness of this object is just barely fainter than the telescopes from earlier sky surveys were able to identify, so new advances in the making of telescopes has also played a part in this discovery.	1
Sentence	24	Now that the discovery data has been released, the scientists will turn over their work to the International Astronomical Union (IAU), which will review it, classify the object and approve a new name to replace the temporary 2003 UB313.	1
Sentence	25	Sometimes the discoverers of a new planetary body get to choose its name, but not always.	1
Sentence	26	"We have a name we really like, and we want it to stick," Brown told reporters at a press conference.	0
Sentence	27	He said the team has submitted the name to the IAU but would not disclose their choice.	0
Sentence	28	In the 2004 naming of Sedna, Brown noted objects found in the Kuiper Belt are usually named after deities of the Underworld.	0
Sentence	29	The astronomers have been using a code name of sorts for the discovery.	1
Sentence	30	The tongue-in-cheek nickname  is "Xena" after the fictional main character of the television series of the same name.	0
Sentence	31	"Because we always wanted to name something Xena," Dr. Brown said in a New York Times report.	0
Sentence	32	There has been controversy in the scientific community about what is and what is not a planet.	1
Sentence	33	Some purists insist the Solar system has only eight planets and that Kuiper Belt object including Pluto, Sedna and 2003 UB313 cannot be listed among the major planets.	0
Sentence	34	A minor furor erupted when the IAU suggested removing Pluto from the pantheon of planets a few years ago.	1
Sentence	35	Because of that Pluto's status as a "planet" in addition to being a Kuiper Belt object was cemented.	0
Sentence	36	But with the discovery of 2003 UB313 the "planet or not" debate may rekindle.	0
Sentence	37	"Pluto has been a planet for so long that the world is comfortable with that," Brown said in the teleconference.	1
Sentence	38	"It seems to me a logical extension that anything bigger than Pluto and farther out is a planet."	0
Sentence	39	Offering additional justification, Brown said 2003 UB313 appears to be surfaced with methane ice, as is Pluto.	1
Sentence	40	That's not the case with other large Kuiper Belt objects, however.	0
Sentence	41	"This object is in a class very much like Pluto," he said.	1
Sentence	42	The new "10th planet" was not the only new discovery in the Kuiper Belt this past week.	1
Sentence	43	José-Luis Ortiz at the Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain announced the discovery of an object called 2003 EL61.	0
Sentence	44	This object, thought to be larger than Sedna, is the brightest trans-Neptune object next to Pluto.	0
Sentence	45	Although some news media confused the discovery of 2003 EL61 with 2003 UB313, they are different objects.	1
Sentence	46	2003 EL61 is so bright, it can be seen with high-end amateur-grade telescopes equipped with CCD cameras.	1
Sentence	47	Although this second discovery may not be as large as 2003 UB313, scientists have confirmed that 2003 EL61 has its own moon.	0

Sentence	6	I don’t know at this point.	0
Sentence	7	There are three prongs to our assessment, first we will conduct a thermal analysis based on the damage, check the flight history and test the area.	0
Sentence	8	We would never take it lightly to send astronauts to the underside of the vehicle to do anything," said the mission management team chairman, John Shannon who also said that until the damage is inspected, "it's way too early to determine whether any repairs are required."	0
Sentence	9	If the damage is found to be irreversible and cannot be fixed, the crew of Endeavour would stay on the ISS.	1
Sentence	10	NASA says that supplies would last until a rescue mission could be launched October 8 by sending up Discovery.	0
Sentence	11	During lift off of Endeavour on August 8, cameras had shown moisture which had gathered on the camera's lens, but NASA states that the object which caused the damage was not caught on camera.	1
Sentence	12	At least nine pieces of debris were reported to have been filmed while the shuttle took off, but NASA says that only three of those pieces of debris had a possibility of hitting the shuttle.	0
Sentence	13	Astronauts are expected to use a laser that is attached to the shuttle's robotic arm to measure the exact depth and size of the gouge on Sunday.	1
Sentence	14	The tile could be repaired by affixing a metal plate over the tile, filling it with putty, or sealing the gouge.	0

Article	95
Sentence	1	U.S. Defence Secretary Robert Gates warned that limiting funding for the United States efforts in Iraq could lead to more bloodshed in the Middle Eastern country.	1
Sentence	2	In an interview with radio talk show host Laura Ingraham, he said it might even lead to ethnic cleansing in Bahgdad and elsewhere in Iraq.	0
Sentence	3	Gates' comment followed a proposal from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to end most spending on the Iraq war in 2008, limiting it to targeted operations against al Qaeda, training for Iraqi troops and U.S. force protection.	1
Sentence	4	Sec.	1
Sentence	5	Gates also said that the duration of the troop increase is not clear and that evaluating whether the Administration's new strategy was working will have to wait till mid-summer.	0
Sentence	6	The Army general charged with day-to-day operations has suggested that the increased deployment may extend to early next year.	0
Sentence	7	Gates discussed the military’s need for funding to finance the war effort.	1
Sentence	8	He said he is concerned about delays in enacting an emergency supplemental bill.	0
Sentence	9	Each house of Congress has passed a version of the bill, and both versions contain a time line for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq.	0
Sentence	10	The House version sets benchmarks of progress to be met by the Iraqi government.	0
Sentence	11	President Bush has vowed to veto any bill containing the withdrawal language.	0
Sentence	12	Gates said each of the armed services will be affected by a delay, with the Army being the worst off.	1
Sentence	13	The service may be forced to suspend training for deploying forces, repairing equipment and putting in place a civilian hiring freeze.	0
Sentence	14	The secretary said a threatened complete cut-off of war "would be dramatic."	0
Sentence	15	—Robert Gates, Secretary of Defense	1
Sentence	16	The Bush administration presents congress with war funding requests as emergency supplementals, not as part of the Pentagon's budget, a practice that began as costs were difficult to estimate during the start of the war.	1
Sentence	17	On October 10 of last year, Lt. Gen. David Melcher, deputy chief of staff for Army programming, material integration and management, told reporters that costs were now predictable enough to be included in the Pentagon budget proposals.	0
Sentence	18	The Bush administration, however, continues with the use of emergency supplementals.	0
Sentence	19	The supplemental funding requests are not accounted in national deficits, which, in the short term, gives the impression of a more positive-looking balance-sheet.	0
Sentence	20	Until recently, the Administration had been sending supplemental requests six months after the fiscal year had started, rather than the six months prior to the start of the Pentagon's fiscal year.	1
Sentence	21	This meant the military used funds alloted originally for procurement, training and repair, instead for its war efforts during the first six months of the fiscal year.	0
Sentence	22	This put pressure on Congress to approve the funding bills quickly to prevent military funding from drying up.	0
Sentence	23	Even a separate bridge fund of $50 billion set up to offset the time pressure did not go very far, as $10 billion are used up every month in Iraq and Afghanistan.	0
Sentence	24	The 2007 and 2008 supplemental requests were sent to Capitol Hill in February, at the same time as the 2008 Defense Department budget request.	0
Sentence	25	Gates said Thursday that increasing troop strength in Iraq and stepping up security in Baghdad is working.	1
Sentence	26	Planners predicted the increase in major bombings by insurgents, Gates told reporters at a news conference.	1
Sentence	27	He blamed a "relatively small" number of people for sectarian killings.	0
Sentence	28	An unnamed U.S. military analyst told reporters last month that 70,000 "hard-line operators and part-time supporters" were actively resisting the current security operations.	0
Sentence	29	"So far, so good…the early signs are positive," Gates said.	1
Sentence	30	"There is a great reluctance to engage in happy talk about this.	0
Sentence	31	It's a tough environment."	0
Sentence	32	"One real possibility is if we abandon some of these areas and withdraw into the countryside or whatever to do these targeted missions that you could have a fairly significant ethnic cleansing inside Baghdad and in Iraq more broadly,"	1
Sentence	33	"What we do know is if Baghdad is in flames and the whole city is engulfed in violence, the prospects for a political solution are almost non-existent,"	1
Sentence	34	Al Qaeda continues to launch dramatic terror attacks against population centres, Gates said, adding some of these attacks are in reaction to the progress being made.	1
Sentence	35	“It’s been part of their strategy since last year to foment sectarian violence,” Gates said.	1
Sentence	36	“I think some of these large car bombs are to counteract some of the positive things that have been happening as a result of even the two brigades going into Baghdad along with a significant number of Iraqi forces.”	0
Sentence	37	Gates said he is pleased with the commitment and cooperation from the Iraqi government.	1
Sentence	38	The Iraqis have delivered the additional troops they promised, and Iraqi commanders in Baghdad are directing operations.	0
Sentence	39	The Iraqi government is allowing Iraqi security forces and coalition forces into any neighbourhood.	0
Sentence	40	The Iraqi government also is maintaining its commitment to no political interference in operations, Gates said.	1

Sentence	1	 U.S. Medicare drug benefit cost estimates rise to $558 billion in latest Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates.	1
Sentence	2	The CBO estimated that the Medicare Modernization Act, "would result in additional direct spending of about $395 billion over the 2004-2013 period."	1
Sentence	3	The estimate included $552 billion mandatory spending for Medicare Part D, offset by savings of $13 billion from changes to Parts A and B, and "estimated savings of $145 billion in Medicaid and other federal programs because the Part D benefit would reduce spending in those federal programs."	0
Sentence	4	Although the projections only slightly modified the net costs, from $552 billion to $558 billion, the $158 billion in offset from previous estimates were completely removed with a limited justification.	1
Sentence	5	"The estimated savings to Medicaid and other federal programs are incorporated in our baseline projections and are not separately identifiable," the CBO said.	0
Sentence	6	The $552 billion dollar figure is missing from the November 2003 estimates, with a total cost for 2004-2013 presented as single line item of $410 billion as "Prescription Drug Benefit (Title I)."	1
Sentence	7	Over the same period the current estimate, which is categorized differently, lists the total costs for the "Benefits and Mandatory Administrative Costs"  as $779 billion, with Part D. Premiums and payments by States reducing the number by $221 billion to $558 billion.	0
Sentence	8	The report presented two tables: one justifying the prior $395 billion figure, including itemizations for "Savings to Medicaid and Other Federal Programs" totaling $145 billion and "Other Spending Effects" totaling $13 billion, and another presenting the current estimate, which only listed "Savings to Medicaid and Other Federal Programs" and "Other Spending Effects"as being "Not Separately Identifiable."	1
Sentence	9	"This just brings us back to the Bush administration's credibility gap," Rep. Charles Rangel of New York told the L.A. Times.	1
Sentence	10	Medicare is overseen by the House Ways and Means Committee, and Rep. Rangels is the senior Democrat on the committee.	0

Sentence	12	he said.	0
Sentence	13	Dr. Mark B. McClellan, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, disagreed, saying "there has been no significant change in the cost of the drug benefit" for the years 2006 - 2015 despite the numbers he brought forward having a cost of $1.2 trillion dollars.	1
Sentence	14	He points to a difference in years covered by his estimates as the reason, and that the numbers represented "gross costs" and did not reflect premiums paid by Medicare beneficiaries, compulsory contributions by states or savings to the Medicaid program.	0

Sentence	3	Levitra and Cialis together control about 30 per cent of the market for such drugs, but Pfizer takes the majority share.	1
Sentence	4	Reminder ads can only call attention to a drug, not claim it works better, or at all.	1
Sentence	5	"In one of [the ad's] scenes, the man strokes the woman's hair and face as she affectionately puts her hand on his wrist," the FDA wrote.	1
Sentence	6	"In the other, she puts her arms around his neck and they embrace."	0

Article	374
Sentence	1	Preliminary results from the National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL), released 15 December 2005 by the US National Center for Education Statistics, indicate gains and losses in literacy among minority adults between 1992 and 2003.	1
Sentence	2	The nationally representative study among US adults age 16 and older found the over-all average prose and document literacy remained relatively unchanged, but quantitative literacy improved 8 points (on a scale of 500.)	1
Sentence	3	Results among minorities were mixed, with White and Asian/Pacific Islander minorities scoring significantly higher than Hispanic or Black ethnicities; Hispanic subjects in particular had sharp decreases in prose and document literacy (-9% and -8%, respectively) and quantitative illiteracy remained unchanged with 50% of subjects scoring at less than basic literacy levels.	0
Sentence	4	The National Assessment of Adult Literacy is the most comprehensive measure of adult literacy in the USA.	1
Sentence	5	The 2003 NAAL, with 19 000 participants, was conducted by the Educational Testing Service, a non-governmental organization which charges for its services.	0
Sentence	6	The survey measured three types of literacy:	1
Sentence	7	In each of these types of literacy the study categorized the subjects into four classes: below basic literacy, basic literacy, intermediate literacy, and proficient literacy.	1
Sentence	8	The break down of literacy was performed across a range of variables, such as ethnicity, gender, age, first language, education, and employment status.	0
Sentence	9	Some of the results were surprising, while others reflect continuing trends in the population.	1
Sentence	10	High proficiency in reading continued to decline between 1992 and 2003 among White subjects, as well as among Hispanics—both down 1%—while Black subjects maintained their level and Asian/Pacific Islanders increased 3%.	1
Sentence	11	Across the ethnicities education level was a greater indicator of reading proficiently with 4.5% of high (secondary) school graduates reading at this level compared with 29% of college graduates and 36% of subjects in graduate studies/degrees.	0

Sentence	13	By ethnicity, the percentage of Black participants remained largely the same while the percentage of Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islanders grew significantly and the percentage of White participants was reduced.	0
Sentence	14	The instructions were made available in English and Spanish, although all testing material was exclusively in English, and 3% of participants who were unable to answer basic literacy screening questions took an alternative assessment.	0
Sentence	15	Even so, 2% of the subject group were unable to communicate with researchers at all in English or Spanish (this was down from 3% in 1992.)	0
Sentence	16	According to the National Centre for Education Statistics, the tests are carried out to measure America's progress in the area of adult literacy.	1

Sentence	1	 File:Lakota Freedom Delegation conference 1.jpg	1
Sentence	2	The Lakota Freedom Delegation, which in December declared that the Lakota people were withdrawing from their treaties with the United States and reasserting their sovereignty as an independent state, is acting without the support of the Treaty Council, the traditional government of the Lakota, Wikinews has learned.	1
Sentence	3	Wikinews spoke with Floyd Looks-For-Buffalo Hand, an Oglala Lakota Treaty Delegate and Elder, also an author and a spiritual leader in the indigenous Lakota religion, and who is also blood uncle to Lakota Freedom Delegation member Canupa Gluha Mani.	1
Sentence	4	The Lakota Freedom Delegation has claimed that, while the BIA-recognized tribal governments of the Lakota have not supported them, the Lakota Freedom Delegation's authority extends from support by the Treaty Council of the Elders of Lakota as well as from the 1974 International Indian Treaty Council.	1
Sentence	5	"There was no treaty withdrawal.	1
Sentence	6	It was three people."	0
Sentence	7	"Russell Means and Duane Martin [Canupa Gluha Mani] and that lady [Phyllis Young], they do not speak for the nation.	1
Sentence	8	You've got to have consensus" among the eight tribes of the Lakota, he said, which the Lakota Freedom Delegation has not obtained.	0
Sentence	9	Mr. Hand stated that he was speaking as a tribal delegate with the consensus of the Oglala Treaty Delegation and his chief, Oliver Red Cloud.	0
Sentence	10	Hand furthermore called the treaty withdrawal event a "publicity stunt" and that furthermore the 1974 meeting was not authorization to act on behalf of the Lakota people.	1
Sentence	11	While Means, Canupa Gluha Mani, and the rest of the delegation "have free speech" and can do as they wish, he said, the Elders of Lakota "stated that they should remove themselves from treaty territory," that is, the Reservations inhabited by the Lakota.	0
Sentence	12	But "they're still living here" (Canupa Gluha Mani has been residing in Asheville, North Carolina since the treaty withdrawal press conference on December 19).	0
Sentence	13	When asked if the above decisions represented the consensus of the whole Treaty Council, Hand stated, "we all do the same because we're all fullbloods.	1
Sentence	14	We all speak our own language."	0
Sentence	15	Hand went on to explain, though, that the Treaty Council was planning to reconsider the Lakota's arrangement with the United States government.	1
Sentence	16	The Treaty Council of all eight Lakota tribes, which will meet on 28–30 January 2008, will consider whether to "sit down to negotiate" with the federal government.	0
Sentence	17	Members of the Lakota Freedom Delegation are expected to take part in that meeting.	0
Sentence	18	European-Americans, Hand said, are "not honoring" the 1851 and 1868 treaties which connected the Lakota to the United States, and noted that the Lakota were the only people to "conquer" the United States during the Indian Wars of the 19th century.	0
Sentence	19	The arrangement with the United States, which he called a "contract", "handcuffs us through the federal programs".	1
Sentence	20	On their own, Hand said, "if we rely on a sovereign nation as a nation, relating to other nations with our economic development I think we can survive."	0
Sentence	21	Hand noted that one possibility under consideration was asserting the right to negotiate independently of the US government with foreign powers in areas such as airport access rights.	0
Sentence	22	The Lakota, he said, would charge foreign airlines half what the United States charges to make use of airports on Lakota soil.	0
Sentence	23	"We can be well off," he argued.	0
Sentence	24	In another contradiction of the Lakota Freedom Delegation's program, Hand said that the Treaty Delegations "don't want technology on our reservation".	1
Sentence	25	One of his concerns was environmentalism.	0
Sentence	26	People of European descent are "taking too much out of Mother Earth", he said, making reference to ongoing environmental effects of uranium mining which has long been a contentious issue on the Lakota reservations.	0
Sentence	27	The Treaty Delegation's goal, he said, is "preserving the land and animals and letting the water remain free."	0
Sentence	28	However, one of the plans of the Lakota Freedom Delegation is to install renewable energy technology on tribal land, such as solar and wind farms.	1
Sentence	29	This follows projects in the past, whereby wind turbines were erected on the Rosebud Reservation.	0
Sentence	30	Such projects would lessen dependence on foreign energy sources, as well as coincide with the Lakota's traditional respect for the environment.	0
Sentence	31	Hand also expressed hope for ethnic solidarity among the non-European peoples of the world.	1
Sentence	32	"All the people of color in this world will go for unity and understanding and peace" if they overthrow the Europeans and establish their own governments, he said.	0

Sentence	24	Fortunately, most of us had something to hold on to ... and we just washed in the wetlands, and scrambled up the highest trees that we could possibly find and sat up there for an hour and a half."	0
Sentence	25	The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade issued a statement saying that radio contact had been lost with a tourist boat in the area which could have been nine Australians and a Japanese national.	0

Sentence	1	Jaslene Gonzalez is not your typical model.	1
Sentence	2	She rose to fame after winning Cycle 8 of America's Next Top Model, and since then, has been aggressively tapping into the fashion industry.	0
Sentence	3	As a result of her  Latin background, Gonzalez has been successful at marketing herself both in the English-speaking and Spanish-speaking worlds.	0
Sentence	4	However, Gonzalez is much much more – a fighter, a humanitarian, and a good Latin granddaughter.	0
Sentence	5	Born in Chicago to a Latina mother, and a Puerto Rican-born father, Gonzalez had, in many ways, a typical U.S. Latino experience – her tight knit family, grandparents, and spirituality played an intrinsic part in her upbringing.	1
Sentence	6	"I went to an all-girl Catholic school and grew up with tons of family.....My family was very close knit and supportive.	1
Sentence	7	They were involved in my life everyday.	0
Sentence	8	So there was so much joy in every little occasion.....Every Sunday we would go to my grandmother's house where we [the family] would hang out together....We enjoyed being around each other and being together," states Gonzalez.	0
Sentence	9	Her grandfather was the director of a local dance group, Viva La Gente, which Gonzalez credits with impacting her life positively.	1
Sentence	10	"I was a dancer for 12 years and life revolved around dancing.	1
Sentence	11	I was a very active girl, and was always involved  with my grandfather's dance studio.	0
Sentence	12	The whole family was.	0
Sentence	13	My aunts, my cousins – everyone took part in performances and were involved in the group...That's how we spent our summers, and we looked forward to being outside, dancing salsa, hip hop, merengue," states Gonzalez.	0
Sentence	14	Through her involvement in the dance studio, Gonzalez's horizon was broadened significantly, and her humanitarian streak began to deepen.	0
Sentence	15	"We were always constantly traveling.	1
Sentence	16	We traveled to Mexico to poor villages where we gave performances to give back to the community," said Gonzalez.	0
Sentence	17	Ironically, ANTM gave her the opportunity to overcome her own difficulties and to further help those in need.	1
Sentence	18	"I went in there, without knowing that I was in an abusive relationship.	0
Sentence	19	They were the ones that brought that up to me...they felt I was emotionally destroyed, they wanted me to get support," commented Gonzalez.	0
Sentence	20	While the ANTM staff was supportive, she also credits her life long dream for helping her get out of the abusive relationship.	0
Sentence	21	"Having a dream and having a goal in life, is the most important thing I did in my life.	1
Sentence	22	Because of that I maneuvered  my way to that dream.	0
Sentence	23	I knew I was better than that, I wanted to be happier,” stated Gonzalez.	0
Sentence	24	Soon after winning ANTM, Gonzalez became a spokesperson for Liz Claiborne and the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and began traveling the country reaching out to women.	1
Sentence	25	"We had several meetings, and they asked me to be a spokesperson.	1
Sentence	26	I was so happy and blessed to help women, to have that title.	0
Sentence	27	It's something I want to do, besides modelling....I enjoy sharing my personal experiences because I can educate them, but I can also save someone's life.	0
Sentence	28	It's something precious, it's a gift," stated Gonzalez.	0
Sentence	29	Abuse is not the only obstacle Jaslene has had to face.	1
Sentence	30	Growing up Latina had its own set of difficulties.	0
Sentence	31	"Being a minority is a challenge no matter what," states Gonzalez.	0
Sentence	32	However, Gonzalez also states that being a Latina has many positive aspects in regards to her profession.	1
Sentence	33	"As a Latina, you have the advantage of being a Latina.	0
Sentence	34	Not only do you have this corporate job, but you can relate to many groups as a person."	0
Sentence	35	When asked if the fashion industry forces Latina models to change certain aspects about themselves, she remarks that she focuses on always staying true to herself.	1
Sentence	36	"Modeling is a difficult job because of what you go through.	0
Sentence	37	80% of the time it's a no...When I go in, I go in like me, I don't have to change anything.	0
Sentence	38	Any time I get a chance to show who I am, I do.	0
Sentence	39	I am a Spanish girl, trying to pursue my dreams.	0
Sentence	40	I try to be the best I can be," remarked Gonzalez.	0
Sentence	41	It is that same confidence and will to succeed that she seems to appreciate in other woman.	1
Sentence	42	"I find women beautiful.	0
Sentence	43	I find a girl with no makeup, not worrying about her style and appearance, I find that sexy.	0
Sentence	44	I find confidence beautiful...Its so simple.	0
Sentence	45	It's being natural and confident," said Gonzalez.	0
Sentence	46	As a role model, she has two key pieces advice that she offers women: nurture your mind with positive thoughts, and identify and foster the principles in life you value.	1
Sentence	47	It is not surprising to see why Gonzalez's family is proud of her.	1
Sentence	48	"My family is so funny.	0
Sentence	49	They are so happy.	0
Sentence	50	I've never seen them so full of life.	0
Sentence	51	My mom acts like she won.	0
Sentence	52	My grandmother screams 'mi flaca' every time she sees me.	0
Sentence	53	They are so proud.	0
Sentence	54	Especially my grandparents.	0
Sentence	55	I was practically raised by them.	0
Sentence	56	To see them see you so happy and successful, there couldn't be a better feeling," said Gonzalez.	0
Sentence	57	She adds that her grandparents would be extremely happy if she appeared on Cristina, the Spanish-language talk show whose host is referred to as "the Spanish Oprah Winfrey."	1

Sentence	1	Researchers at the Brookings Institution, a non-profit think tank located in Washington D.C., have recently accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of making improper use of almost 16 pages and six figures from a 1982 translation of a 1978 textbook in his economics dissertation.	1

Sentence	7	Many Russian government officials at the time would pay a ghostwriter for such publications, as gaining a degree could add legitimacy to one's governing policy.	1

Sentence	3	Guiding Light, which entered the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest-running dramatic series in the world, started on radio in 1937 as a series of stories about faith, in which characters beset with troubles would talk to trusted Reverend Ruthledge, the keeper of "the guiding light" which shone from his window.	1

Sentence	8	Andrew Strauss top scored for England with 46 and Bopara added precious runs at the tail end of England's innings with 27*, in a similar fashion to his 52 against Sri Lanka.	0
Sentence	9	South Africa started batting in emphatic fashion: reaching 50 in just 5.4 overs: in contrast, England had taken 15.1 overs to reach 50; and while de Villiers was lucky not to be out on just 21 after being caught behind by Nixon off of the bowling of Anderson, (it was an edge so faint that the umpire, Steve Bucknor, couldn't hear it and couldn't give it), South Africa kept the foot on the gas and even after losing de Villiers on 42 they kept the run rate around 8, resulting in Smith getting 50 off of just 34 deliveries with only 9 dot balls, finishing on 85*.	1

Article	1
Sentence	1	 The definition of what is and what is not a planet is being challenged by a newly announced discovery Friday.	1
Sentence	2	Astronomers from the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, California said they found a chunk of ice and rock in the solar system larger than Pluto.	0
Sentence	3	The object, given the temporary generic name of 2003 UB313, is about 9 billion miles away from the sun.	1
Sentence	4	It was first photographed in 2003 using the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii.	0
Sentence	5	But it was an indistinguishable bright spot among a field of stars in an area of the sky where astronomers don't usually look at for planets or planet-type objects.	0
Sentence	6	Solar system bodies found beyond the orbit of Neptune are called "trans-Neptunian objects".	1
Sentence	7	One of them, Pluto, is also classified as a planet.	0
Sentence	8	Up until now all other planet-like discoveries beyond Neptune, including Sedna, found by the same Palomar team in 2004, are called Kuiper Belt objects, or minor planets.	0
Sentence	9	Using a photo taken on January 8, the Palomar team compared it with previous 2003 UB313 photos to triangulate the object's distance, brightness and orbit.	1
Sentence	10	Using mathematical formulas, they found a range of sizes for 2003 UB313, with an estimated average showing the approximate diameter of the new body to be about 2,600 kilometers.	1
Sentence	11	But even at the smallest estimate scientists are certain 2003 UB313 is larger than Pluto's 2,250 kilometer diameter.	0
Sentence	12	To determine size, Scientists deduce the relative size of a solar system object by its brightness, just as one can infer the size of a faraway light bulb if one knows its wattage.	1
Sentence	13	The reflectance of 2003 UB313 is not yet known for sure.	0
Sentence	14	Scientists can not yet tell how much light from the sun is reflected away from its surface, but the amount of light the planet does reflect puts a lower limit on its size.	0
Sentence	15	"Even if it reflected 100 percent of the light reaching it, it would still be as big as Pluto," Michael E. Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology said in a NASA press release.	1
Sentence	16	"I'd say it's probably one and a half times the size of Pluto, but we're not sure yet of the final size."	0
Sentence	17	"We are 100 percent confident that this is the first object bigger than Pluto ever found in the outer solar system," Brown added.	1
Sentence	18	The object is inclined by a whopping 45 degrees to the main plane of the solar system, where most of the other planets orbit.	1
Sentence	19	That's why it eluded discovery: nobody was looking there until now, Brown said.	0
Sentence	20	Most objects in the solar system are just a few degrees from the main plane of the solar system, called the Ecliptic.	1
Sentence	21	Pluto, which is considered substantially different from the rest of the planets, is only 17 degrees from this main plane.	0
Sentence	22	Astronomers who study the sky for asteroids and comets usually look in the region of the sky that the rest of the planets occupy.	0
Sentence	23	The brightness of this object is just barely fainter than the telescopes from earlier sky surveys were able to identify, so new advances in the making of telescopes has also played a part in this discovery.	1
Sentence	24	Now that the discovery data has been released, the scientists will turn over their work to the International Astronomical Union (IAU), which will review it, classify the object and approve a new name to replace the temporary 2003 UB313.	1
Sentence	25	Sometimes the discoverers of a new planetary body get to choose its name, but not always.	1
Sentence	26	"We have a name we really like, and we want it to stick," Brown told reporters at a press conference.	0
Sentence	27	He said the team has submitted the name to the IAU but would not disclose their choice.	0
Sentence	28	In the 2004 naming of Sedna, Brown noted objects found in the Kuiper Belt are usually named after deities of the Underworld.	0
Sentence	29	The astronomers have been using a code name of sorts for the discovery.	1
Sentence	30	The tongue-in-cheek nickname  is "Xena" after the fictional main character of the television series of the same name.	0
Sentence	31	"Because we always wanted to name something Xena," Dr. Brown said in a New York Times report.	0
Sentence	32	There has been controversy in the scientific community about what is and what is not a planet.	1
Sentence	33	Some purists insist the Solar system has only eight planets and that Kuiper Belt object including Pluto, Sedna and 2003 UB313 cannot be listed among the major planets.	0
Sentence	34	A minor furor erupted when the IAU suggested removing Pluto from the pantheon of planets a few years ago.	1
Sentence	35	Because of that Pluto's status as a "planet" in addition to being a Kuiper Belt object was cemented.	0
Sentence	36	But with the discovery of 2003 UB313 the "planet or not" debate may rekindle.	0
Sentence	37	"Pluto has been a planet for so long that the world is comfortable with that," Brown said in the teleconference.	1
Sentence	38	"It seems to me a logical extension that anything bigger than Pluto and farther out is a planet."	0
Sentence	39	Offering additional justification, Brown said 2003 UB313 appears to be surfaced with methane ice, as is Pluto.	1
Sentence	40	That's not the case with other large Kuiper Belt objects, however.	0
Sentence	41	"This object is in a class very much like Pluto," he said.	1
Sentence	42	The new "10th planet" was not the only new discovery in the Kuiper Belt this past week.	1
Sentence	43	José-Luis Ortiz at the Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain announced the discovery of an object called 2003 EL61.	0

Sentence	3	The Interior Ministry reported that by noon local time, turnout had reached 31.2%, a level not seen since 1981 and ten percent higher than the last election for President of France.	0
Sentence	4	Voting stations were to begin closing at 6:00 p.m., but those in large cities will be open until 8:00 p.m.	1
Sentence	5	Initial projections are expected to be published at that time, based on a partial count of votes from hundreds of stations around the country.	0
Sentence	6	Romain Pinault, an election official at a school in Paris' eighth district, told Associated Press a second voting station was added to handle the extra voters, "The participation rate [at this location] is about 30 percent more than five years ago."	1
Sentence	7	Nicolas Sarkozy of the UMP and Ségolène Royal of the Socialist Party are considered the frontrunners.	1
Sentence	8	But the latest opinion polls suggested a third of the 44.5 million registered voters were still not sure of their choice, lending hope to third-placed candidate François Bayrou (UDF) and to Jean-Marie Le Pen (National Front), whom most polls had in fourth.	0
Sentence	9	One of the reasons for the high turnout seems to be that there are 3.3 million newly registered voters, many from lower-income immigrant neighborhoods, many of which saw civil unrest in 2005.	1
Sentence	10	Nicolas Sarkozy was interior minister at the time and was criticized for his handling of the situation.	0
Sentence	11	Local Socialist leader Ali Romdhane, who led a campaign drive in such a neighborhood, told the Los Angeles Times, "In a way, Sarkozy helped us.	1

Sentence	7	The amendment's passage would have prevented AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and other broadband providers from charging content providers like Google, Yahoo, Amazon or eBay for priority access to their networks.	0
Sentence	8	Democrats were largely in favour of the legislation with 140 Ayes and 58 Noes, whereas only 11 Republicans voted for the measure, with 211 against.	0
Sentence	9	House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi argued that "The imposition of additional fees for Internet content providers would unduly burden Web-based small businesses and start-ups," and that "They would also hamper communications by noncommercial users, those using religious speech, promoting civic involvement and exercising First Amendment freedoms."	1

Sentence	11	Chief technology officer for BellSouth William L. Smith told the Washington Post that telephone companies should be able to charge companies for having their content load faster than that of competitors.	0

Sentence	1	Millions may starve in Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia, and Djibouti in East Africa, because of extreme drought, combined with inequalities built into mechanisms for distributing food, according to the analysis made by Amartya Sen, who was awarded the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998.	1
Sentence	2	War in parts of the region is an extra exacerbating factor.	0
Sentence	3	The countries need immediate food, water, seeds and any other agricultural product, according to the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which reports that millions of people are on the brink of starvation due to the recent severe droughts that have been devastating the area.	1

Sentence	11	The FAO had called for domestic food purchases in areas where harvests were expected to be favorable, coupled with food aid imports elsewhere, the UN's Mr Dujarric said.	1

Sentence	1	John C. Mather of NASA and George F. Smoot of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory shared the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physics for "their discovery of the blackbody form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation."	1
Sentence	2	The Nobel Prize Committee cited the physicists for their work on the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) project.	1
Sentence	3	COBE revealed fluctuations in faint microwave signals from space that are thought to be remnants of the Big Bang.	0
Sentence	4	Although the precise origin of the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background is not yet clear, they may represent clumps in the very early universe that led to the galaxies seen today.	1
Sentence	5	Prior to the COBE map of the universe, it was unclear why the universe contained stars and galaxies rather than an evenly distributed dust cloud.	1
Sentence	6	Theorists had predicted that a sensitive measurement of microwaves from the sky would reveal minute temperature fluctuations, which represent variations in the density of matter in the early universe.	0
Sentence	7	The denser portions served as seeds for galaxies that formed later.	0
Sentence	8	COBE was the first experiment sensitive enough to confirm the predicted temperature variations encoded in the map of the microwave background.	0

Sentence	1	Ten people, including  former Royal Lao Army general Vang Pao, 77, and a former United States Army officer Harrison Jack, 60, were arrested Monday in six different cities in California, USA after authorities with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), uncovered a plot to bring down the government of Laos.	1
Sentence	2	Suspects were arrested in Chico, Fresno, Los Angeles, Sacramento, Stockton and Woodland.	1
Sentence	3	The plot, said prosecutors, involved obtaining C-4 explosives, AK-47 rifles, rockets, land mines and Stinger missiles, which were to be shipped to Thailand, and then used to take down the main branch of the Laotian government by blowing up the government's main buildings in Vientiane, the capital of Laos.	1
Sentence	4	The bombs would be deployed using "special operation mercenaries," but undercover agents working with the ATF foiled the plot when the suspects were tricked into buying the weapons and supplies they needed from the undercover agents.	1
Sentence	5	The government's investigation was dubbed "Operation Tarnished Eagle".	0
Sentence	6	"These defendants had developed an audacious plan to overthrow the government of Laos, and were seeking to arm themselves with automatic rifles, rockets and surface-to-air missiles," said the assistant to the U.S. Attorney General, Kenneth Wainstein in a statement to the press.	1
Sentence	7	"The individuals arrested today thought an arms dealer would provide the necessary weapons and personnel to assist them in the violent overthrow of another government.	1
Sentence	8	An undercover ATF agent led them to believe he could fulfill their needs," said acting ATF director Michael Sullivan in a statement to the press.	0
Sentence	9	According to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court, the plot was put together by a Lao liberation movement known as Neo Hom, led in the U.S. by Vang Pao, and had conducted extensive fund-raising activities, surveillance operations and an insurgent force within Laos.	1
Sentence	10	Vang Pao led Hmong forces backed by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency against the communist Pathet Lao in the "Secret War" in Laos in the 1960s and 1970s.	1
Sentence	11	He served in the Royal Army of Laos, holding the rank of major general.	0

Sentence	13	There were plans to name an elementary school after him in Wisconsin, which is home to many Hmong people.	0
Sentence	14	Another man named in the charges, Jack, is a former California National Guard lieutenant colonel and a 1968 West Point graduate.	1
Sentence	15	He was involved in covert operations during the Vietnam War.	0

Sentence	25	In the past year, Thailand has had to deal with a stream of Hmong refugees, and has been forcibly repatriating them  to Laos.	1
Sentence	26	Many of the refugees said they were associates of Secret War veterans and were fleeing from persecution.	0
Sentence	27	They hoped to follow other Hmong refugees to the West.	0
Sentence	28	Laos spokesman Yong said the Hmong in Thailand were not fighters but victims of human traffickers, and that dissident groups had been long ago been suppressed in Laos.	1
Sentence	29	"The arrest of Vang Pao and his group might not have direct impact to Laos as we have nothing to do with them, but it would be a good news for Hmong minorities since the traffickers would have no excuse to lure them to Thailand to seek resettlement in the U.S. with Vang Pao," Yong said.	0
Sentence	30	On Monday, Thai and Laotian officials met in Bangkok to discuss border security issues, and the two countries agreed to deport the Hmong in Thailand to Laos, Yong said.	1

Sentence	1	Currency hedge fund operator Gregory Chase was alerted by internet sources that former Senator Mike Gravel, a Democratic presidential candidate in the race for presidency, will be excluded from the latest upcoming debate (that will be held this Tuesday at Drexel University and broadcast on MSNBC).	1
Sentence	2	Chase immediately took action by contacting NBC executives, who are charge of the debate.	0
Sentence	3	The letter was sent and it includes an explanation as to why NBC should not censor Gravel, and also holds an offer of US$1 million to include Gravel.	1
Sentence	4	The US$1 million offer could be given to NBC in exchange for allowing the senator to participate in the 2-hour debate, by either Chase purchasing a million dollars worth of advertising space on their network, donating the million to NBC's favorite charity, or giving the million dollars to NBC's parent company, General Electric.	0
Sentence	5	The decision made by Chase to give the million dollars to NBC is due to criteria that Gravel did not meet, which includes the following; having campaigned in New Hampshire and/or Iowa at least 14 times in the past year, not polling high enough in national polls, and Sen. Gravel's campaign had not raised more than US$1 million.	1
Sentence	6	According to the Gravel for President campaign, Gravel reportedly visited either New Hampshire or Iowa at least 14 times since his announcement on April 17, 2006, and according to a recent poll by CNN, Gravel is tied with fellow candidates Rep. Dennis Kucinich, Sen. Joe Biden, and Sen. Chris Dodd and 1% behind Gov.	1
Sentence	7	Bill Richardson.	0
Sentence	8	The fundraising requirement is the only criteria not achieved.	1

Sentence	10	My name is Gregory Chase, I live in New Hampshire, and I run a hedge fund that trades currencies.	1
Sentence	11	On a personal basis, separate from Senator Mike Gravel's campaign, I am making an independent expenditure of a greater magnitude than what some other candidates' campaigns will spend in the state through the primary.	0
Sentence	12	I am sending statewide direct mail, installing lawn signs, and running ads supporting Senator Mike Gravel every day between now and the New Hampshire primary in the state's three largest newspapers: The Union Leader, The Concord Monitor, and The Nashua Telegraph.	0
Sentence	13	It was with great disappointment that I learned that NBC decided to exclude Senator Gravel, and only Senator Gravel, from the field of Democratic candidates for their October 30th 2007 debate at Drexel University in Philadelphia.	1
Sentence	14	I learned about Senator Gravel by watching televised debates earlier this year.	0
Sentence	15	In my opinion his ideas regarding foreign policy, military spending, and energy independence are advanced relative to the other candidates.	0
Sentence	16	I would like Senator Gravel’s ideas to be heard.	0
Sentence	17	NBC cited fund raising as a criteria for inclusion in this debate, stating that a candidate must have raised $1 million to participate.	1
Sentence	18	Most current and aspiring politicians, along with the general public, believe money and special interests play too large a part in elections.	0
Sentence	19	I don't understand why a certain level of fund raising is a requirement to participate in a presidential debate.	0
Sentence	20	Senator Gravel is proud of the fact that that his candidacy is built on ideas, not cash.	0
Sentence	21	As you know, polls taken at this point in the primary measure name recognition more than where votes will actually be cast.	1
Sentence	22	The public is just starting to focus on the upcoming primary.	0
Sentence	23	Once New Hampshire voters learn about Senator Gravel, and they will, I believe that a substantial number of voters will decide that Senator Gravel's ideas are more in line with their own than with any other candidate's.	0
Sentence	24	NBC is doing New Hampshire and the nation a disservice by excluding Senator Gravel.	0
Sentence	25	Your company is censoring a multi-term United States senator, a veteran, and a patriot.	0
Sentence	26	If it would help get Senator Gravel back into the debate, I offer to purchase $1 million of advertising from NBC, or simply pay NBC $1 million in exchange for the service of allowing Senator Gravel to participate in your debate.	1
Sentence	27	As of October 26, 2007, Chase has not received a response from NBC regarding the offer.	1

Sentence	3	Savarino bought the building from owner Bob Freudenheim for US$1.00 and states that he hopes to save as much of the building as possible, including the facade, at least 20 feet of the side walls, all of the back walls including the elevator tower and if possible all three floors.	1
Sentence	4	There is one major downside to the purchase; he inherits the over $400,000 tax lien against the property.	0

Sentence	14	Originally the city ordered an emergency demolition on the building after Freudenheim gave them permission to demolish it on June 12 during an emergency Preservation Board meeting.	1

Sentence	1	—Ray LaHood, U.S. transport secretary	1
Sentence	2	United States officials have unveiled new plans which require air traffic controllers to have longer rest periods between shifts after a spate of controllers fell asleep while on duty at airports across the country.	1
Sentence	3	Announcing the plans, transport secretary Ray LaHood said he was "outraged" by the incidents.	0
Sentence	4	The new plans, which the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the U.S. government agency responsible for aviation, said would be implemented immediately, come after another controller was suspended this week when they fell asleep while directing aircraft near Miami.	1
Sentence	5	The incident was the sixth this year; controllers have fallen asleep in Nevada, Washington D.C., and Tennessee.	0
Sentence	6	In one incident, two commercial passenger jets landed without any direction from the control tower because the controller on duty had fallen asleep.	0
Sentence	7	LaHood said controllers would be required to have a minimum of nine hours rest between shifts, an increase of an hour, and more supervisors would be required during night shifts, and they will be restricted in what shifts they can swap with colleagues.	1
Sentence	8	"I don't know when I've ever been madder," LaHood said in a television interview on Fox News Sunday.	0
Sentence	9	"We're not going to stand by and let that happen."	0
Sentence	10	"We've taken steps, as of this morning, to begin changing schedules for controllers, to change schedules for managers, and to make sure that controllers cannot switch in and out of their schedules in order for the convenience of them if they are not well-rested," LaHood said.	1
Sentence	11	He vowed that he would ensure any controllers falling asleep on duty would face consequences.	0
Sentence	12	"On my watch, controllers will not be paid to take naps," he said.	0
Sentence	13	"We're not going to allow that."	0
Sentence	14	Earlier this week, Hank Krakowski, the head of air traffic organization at the FAA, resigned from his position after LaHood said the crisis in U.S. control towers was "unacceptable", and vowed to resolve the issue.	1
Sentence	15	"I am totally outraged by these incidents," LaHood said.	0
Sentence	16	"This is absolutely unacceptable.	0
Sentence	17	The American public trusts us to run a safe system."	0
Sentence	18	The results of a study on how fatigue affects controllers will soon be published and the FAA may make changes.	1
Sentence	19	But LaHood insisted controllers had to "take personal responsibility" for the safety of aircraft over the U.S., and they should not make irresponsible shift changes which will make them tired and put passengers at risk.	0
Sentence	20	He said all the controllers involved in the incidents had been suspended, and could ultimately be sacked.	0
Sentence	21	The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, a labor union representing controllers in the U.S., said the FAA had their "full support" in implementing the new steps to tackle fatigue.	0

Sentence	16	"His influence in India has been negligible.	1

Sentence	18	"So he took off for a while [in India] as long as he was appreciated in the West."	0

Sentence	22	While many adherents praise Maharishi for propagating a scientifically verifiable ancient method to help them deal with the stress of modern life, some disenchanted followers considered TM a quasi-religious cult more interested in raising funds than spirits.	0

Sentence	1	The animated series Family Guy returned to the FOX television network with a new episode Sunday for the first time since it was taken off the schedule three years ago.	1
Sentence	2	Although the show kept most of its audience that lead-in The Simpsons gave, FOX was still fourth out of five major broadcast networks in the half-hour, losing most notably to ABC's hit Desperate Housewives (UPN, the other major American broadcast network, does not air original programming on Sundays).	0
Sentence	3	However, the season premiere of Family Guy and the series debut of American Dad (which helped usher in what the network termed "The New FOX Sunday") helped bring FOX to the #2 spot out of five networks in the crucial 18 to 49 demographic, one of the most important to advertisers in the key May sweeps period.	1
Sentence	4	"Sweeps" occurs four times a year and helps networks and independent affiliates determine how much a fixed amount of time for commercial advertisement will cost (the higher the ratings, the more revenue for the networks selling the time to advertisers).	0
Sentence	5	On the whole, Family Guy averaged a 6.3 rating in the overnights as posted by Zap2It.	1
Sentence	6	While the overnight ratings are fairly accurate, the numbers are preliminary and are subject to minor change.	0
Sentence	7	One ratings point is equal to 1,096,000 households, as there are now 109,600,000 households in the United States with at least one television.	0
Sentence	8	This translates into a little more than 6.9 million households whose sets were tuned into Family Guy, as recorded by the sample of "Nielsen families," who record their viewing habits and contribute to the ratings process the US uses.	0
Sentence	9	The use of the word "share" in the article means that it is the rough percentage of viewers with their sets on at that hour tuning into a certain program.	0
Sentence	10	For example, nine percent of viewers in the United States with their televisions on at 9 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time were tuned to Family Guy.	0
Sentence	11	This only added up to a 9 household share for the hour, compared to an 11 share for Law & Order: Criminal Intent on NBC, a 14 share for a CBS Hallmark Hall of Fame movie of the week (traditionally only aired during the key sweeps periods), and a 23 share for the aforementioned Desperate Housewives.	1
Sentence	12	Averaged with the performance of American Dad, a cartoon produced by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, FOX earned a mere 5.8 rating/9 share for the hour.	0
Sentence	13	The episode revolved around a big scheme Peter Griffin, the main character of the series, conjured.	1
Sentence	14	To give his wife Lois (who no longer finds him sexually attractive) a second honeymoon in order to "spice up" their love life, he pretends to be actor Mel Gibson so they can stay in a new luxury hotel for free.	0
Sentence	15	Peter stumbles upon a sequel to the film The Passion of the Christ, and vows to keep the movie from ever seeing the light of day.	0
Sentence	16	To get the movie back, Gibson kidnaps Lois and keeps her captive on top of Mount Rushmore, which leads to a scene in which the three battle on top of the monument, in a homage to the film North by Northwest.	0

Article	162
Sentence	1	Following the ousting of Thailand's Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra from power, those seeking to peacefully protest the imposition of a military junta in the country on May 22 have adopted a gesture found in The Hunger Games book and film series, curling the little finger and thumb into the palm and raising the three middle fingers in the air.	1
Sentence	2	Use of the gesture as a form of protest began last weekend in Bangkok, the capital of the country.	0
Sentence	3	This form of protest has drawn the attention of Thailand's military junta, the National Council for Peace and Order, who announced its intent on Tuesday to arrest protestors who display the gesture, in violation of orders to stop.	1
Sentence	4	Speaking on behalf of the junta, Colonel Weerachon Sukhondhapatipak said to the Associated Press, "At this point we are monitoring the movement.	0
Sentence	5	If it is an obvious form of resistance, then we have to control it so it doesn't cause any disorder in the country."	0
Sentence	6	In a comment to the Bangkok Post, Thai army Colonel Winthai Suwaree shared a similar sentiment: "[The junta] must look at [the protester's] intention, what they want to communicate and surrounding circumstances".	0
Sentence	7	Following the ousting of Thailand's elected government in reportedly the fourteenth coup experienced by the country since the adoption of constitutional monarchy in 1932, the country remains affected by a curfew spanning midnight to 4am, with only Phuket, Koh Samui and Pattaya exempted, as they are beach resorts frequented by tourists, a group for whom the junta made the move in a bid to avoid adverse effects to the country's tourist industry.	1
Sentence	8	Nonetheless, in the wake of the coup, the United States Department of State (DoS) advised "U.S. citizens reconsider any non-essential travel to Thailand, particularly Bangkok".	1
Sentence	9	The DoS also informed US citizens to stay away from groups of protestors, citing that "even demonstrations that are meant to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence."	0
Sentence	10	Other restrictions placed on citizens by the junta include internet censorship and restrictions on television broadcasts.	0
Sentence	11	Also banned were assemblies of five or more people with political intent.	0
Sentence	12	Solitary displays of the gesture was among a few forms of protest utilized by the Thai people in Bangkok on Sunday, amid the placement of almost 6000 soldiers and police officers by the junta in an effort to suppress protests.	1
Sentence	13	Other displays of defiance included protestors banding together in flash mobs or peacefully walking through the central shopping district donning masks in an attempt to bypass security forces stationed there.	0
Sentence	14	The gesture finds its origins in The Hunger Games series, where it was a sign of thanks, admiration, and farewell to a loved one, later gaining significance, in the second book Catching Fire, as a symbol of rebellion against the totalitarian government of Panem.	1
Sentence	15	Protesters, however, have found their own ways of deriving meaning behind the gesture, with some reportedly interpreting it as standing for liberté, égalité, fraternité, values popularized by the French Revolution.	0
Sentence	16	A purported alternative interpretation by protesters held the gesture stood for freedom, election, and democracy.	1
Sentence	17	Still others have created a photo montage of the gesture with a picture from the source movie, which circulated online, with the caption "1.	0
Sentence	18	No Coup, 2.	0
Sentence	19	Liberty, 3.	0
Sentence	20	Democracy" written on the three extended fingers.	0
Sentence	21	Manik Sethisuwan has taken to Twitter with this message: "Dear #HungerGames.	0
Sentence	22	We've taken your sign as our own.	0
Sentence	23	Our struggle is non-fiction.	0
Sentence	24	Thanks."	0
Sentence	25	Sombat Boonngam-anong, a social activist who has made efforts to rally the Thai people in continued protest, offered his own interpretation of the gesture on Facebook.	1
Sentence	26	"Raising three fingers has become a symbol in calling for fundamental political rights".	0
Sentence	27	Sombat belongs to the "Red Shirts", a protest group which has supported Shinawatra's government and the earlier government of Thaksin Shinawatra, her brother, and conducted protests amid prosecution by the junta.	0
Sentence	28	Sombat advocated a form of silent protest, raising of their right arms, "3 fingers, 3 times a day" for 30 seconds at 9 a.m., 1 p.m., and 5 p.m., in public locations where police officers and the military are absent.	0
Sentence	29	"Let's escalate the anti-coup movement three times a day together," said Sombat.	0
Sentence	30	Weerachon expressed awareness of the gesture's origins, stating "We know it comes from the movie, and let's say it represents resistance against the authorities.	1
Sentence	31	[...] If a single individual raises three fingers in the air, we are not going to arrest him or her.	0
Sentence	32	But if it is a political gathering of five people or more, then we will have to take some action.	0
Sentence	33	If it persists, then we will have to make an arrest."	0
Sentence	34	On Sunday, protestors were reportedly detained for that reason.	0
Sentence	35	The decision to criminalize displays of the gesture have drawn the criticism of Human Rights Watch, stating it expresses "a mindset that views human rights with disdain, and sees youthful defiance as the enemy."	1
Sentence	36	Human Rights Watch's Asia director, Brad Adams, remarked: "The Thai military's assault on basic human rights has apparently grown to not only target peaceful protesters but now also silent ones as well — since now just holding up an arm with a three-finger salute is enough to earn the junta's ire".	0
Sentence	37	The National Council for Peace and Order has stated it imposed military rule over the country due to political deadlock resulting from demonstrations spanning seven months, which occasionally erupted into violence.	1
Sentence	38	Last year, on the volatile political situation in Thailand, scholar Nicholas Farrelly wrote in the Australian Journal of International Affairs: "Each year, Thailand tends to experience at least one period of frenzied coup speculation.	0
Sentence	39	Coups clearly still play a major role in Thai mainstream politics."	0

Sentence	1	 NORWAY; Kristiansand: In the weekend between the 11. and 13. of March the Norwegian Centre Party held its annual National Conference in Kristiansand.	1
Sentence	2	The conference was clearly inspired by the prospects of a majority in the parliament together with the Norwegian Socialist Left- and Labour Party, according to all polls.	0
Sentence	3	In this conference the leader, Åslaug Haga, was re-elected against one vote and to great applaus from the 187 other voters.	1

Sentence	9	In the conference Haga was joined by several other active members in underlining the Centre Partys role as the most dedicated decentralizationing-party in Norway.	0
Sentence	10	It was clear from the debaters that the main role of the party in a possibly upcoming majority-government (majority in parliament) with the Labour and Socialist Left Party mainly was to make the government focus on turning around the sentralization of Norway and to hinder the Labour Party and the Conservative Party from cooperating on sending a new application for membership in the European Union.	1

Sentence	1	Four officers from London's Metropolitan Police went on trial today accused of repeatedly beating a Muslim arrested on suspicion of helping "terrorist organisations operating abroad."	1
Sentence	2	The men deny assaulting Babar Ahmad, 36, in his home, in a police van and in a police station.	0
Sentence	3	The assault charges stem from the December 2003 arrest in the city's south-west.	1
Sentence	4	Less than a year earlier a similar operation in Manchester had seen an officer stabbed to death by a suspect now serving life in prison.	0
Sentence	5	Jonathan Laidlaw, prosecuting, told the jury in Southwark Crown Court the officers had likely been informed Ahmad had militant training and involvement in overseas fighting.	0
Sentence	6	The police team was from the specialist Territorial Support Group.	0
Sentence	7	—Custody sergeant	1
Sentence	8	Whilst acknowledging fears Ahmed, who was released without charge, could pose a threat, Laidlaw rejects this actually being the case upon arrival at his home.	1
Sentence	9	Woken from sleeping beside his wife at 05:00 by calls of "police, police", "[d]ressed only in his pyjamas and barefooted, Mr Ahmad raised his arms above his head to indicate that he was not going to fight or to present any sort of danger or threat to the police," claims Laidlaw.	0
Sentence	10	Police Constable Roderick James-Bowen, 40, was first into the room and knocked Ahmed back into a window, breaking it.	1
Sentence	11	Laidlaw had "no complaint" about this action but when "entirely submissive" Ahmed was handcuffed "[t]he defendants subjected him to a sustained and very violent assault - in effect they gave him a beating or they beat him up."	0
Sentence	12	The prosecutor contends the four officers - PC James-Bowen alongside PCs Nigel Cowley, 33, and Mark Jones, 43, and Detective Constable John Donohue, 36 - "punched and [beat Ahmed] on the floor".	1
Sentence	13	The accused are said to have called Ahmed a "fucking bastard" and a "fucking cunt".	0
Sentence	14	"On the floor the assault continued as his wife called out for the police to stop," Laidlaw continued.	0
Sentence	15	This was followed, he claims, by a visit to Ahmed's prayer room, where he was positioned as if praying and asked "Where is your god now?"	0
Sentence	16	As part of the investigation into suspicions Amhed led a group "providing logistical support, financial assistance, recruits and computer expertise" to foreign militant groups, MI5 bugged the house.	1
Sentence	17	The jury was played a ten minute recording covering the arrest in which shouts, screams and apparent muffled commands were heard.	0
Sentence	18	There followed a transfer via police van to Charing Cross police station.	1
Sentence	19	In the back of the van "[t]he officer sitting nearest to Mr Ahmad's head asked him where he was born and when he replied London, that officer punched him in the back of the head.	0
Sentence	20	The same officer then lifted Mr Ahmad's upper body and held him in a headlock with both arms.	0
Sentence	21	After releasing him [the officer] said: 'You fucking cunt, you'll remember this day for the rest of your life.'"	0
Sentence	22	—Jonathan Laidlaw, prosecuting	1
Sentence	23	At the police station Ahmed says he was led to an area unviewed by CCTV cameras and punched and kicked.	1
Sentence	24	He was presented in "a collapsing state" to the custody sergeant who was told Ahmed had been violent and resisted arrest.	0
Sentence	25	However, the custody sergeant was quoted in court as hearing screams at the police station.	0
Sentence	26	"I would describe the screaming as what I believed was a man and that he was in prolonged discomfort and pain.	0
Sentence	27	It was definitely the sound of pain and not of him shouting out," Laidlaw quoted the sergeant.	0
Sentence	28	The officers are accused by the prosecution of having "lied" about any resistance offered by Ahmed, who was left with "areas of bruising, reddening and grazes to [his] head and neck, bruising to the chest, areas of bruising to [his] back, extensive bruising and grazing of the arms.	1
Sentence	29	In effect, there were injuries all over the victim's body."	0
Sentence	30	Ahmed was re-arrested in 2004 and has spent the last seven years in custody facing extradition to the US.	1
Sentence	31	The US seeks to try him for fundraising for militancy amid claims he is a member of al-Qaeda; though initially a ruling in favour of extradition was reached an appeal is pending.	0

Sentence	1	The  Large Hadron Collider (LHC) that started preliminary experiments on September 10, 2008 in  CERN, Geneva, and the planned  International Linear Collider (ILC) will carry out a series of experiments in the future to validate the  standard model of  particle physics.	1
Sentence	2	The model predicts that  Higgs boson particles gives mass to all fundamental particles and explains the existence of  dark matter, or invisible matter in between galaxies.	0
Sentence	3	The LHC is a 27 kilometer long circular high energy  particle accelerator which took more than 20 years and USD $9 billion to build.	1
Sentence	4	In the next few weeks the machine will collide opposing beams of  protons charged with approximately 7 TeV of energy resulting in cataclysmic conditions that will mimic the beginning of time, a re-creation of the  Big Bang.	0
Sentence	5	An upgraded version of the LHC was announced, nicknamed the "super LHC".	1
Sentence	6	The new accelerator will perform ten times the number of collisions as the current LHC over the same time.	0
Sentence	7	The upgrade will feature a new injection system and enhanced detectors to cope with the increase in data packets from collisions.	0
Sentence	8	The bigger International Linear Collider, nicknamed "Einstein's telescope", is planned by the International Technology Recommendation Panel (ITRP).	1
Sentence	9	The ILC will have a collision energy of 500 GeV and will collide  electrons with particles of  antimatter, called  positrons, along a 30-40 km completely straight tunnel.	0
Sentence	10	The ILC's two giant "guns" pointing at each other would be able to accelerate electrons and positrons to near-light speeds before smashing them together.	0
Sentence	11	"The LHC smashes protons together to discover new particles but also generates lots of debris that obscures the fine detail.	1
Sentence	12	The ILC would be a much cleaner machine and tell us far more about their real nature."	0
Sentence	13	says  Brian Foster, professor of experimental physics at Oxford University and European director of the project.	0
Sentence	14	The host country for the ILC has not yet been chosen but it is planned to have the machine constructed by late 2010.	0
Sentence	15	The new machine will cost an estimated USD $7 billion to build.	0
Sentence	16	Physicists hope that ILC might be able to resolve some of the questions raised by Einstein's theories of relativity.	0

Sentence	1	 File:Lakota Freedom Delegation conference 1.jpg	1
Sentence	2	The Lakota Freedom Delegation, which in December declared that the Lakota people were withdrawing from their treaties with the United States and reasserting their sovereignty as an independent state, is acting without the support of the Treaty Council, the traditional government of the Lakota, Wikinews has learned.	1
Sentence	3	Wikinews spoke with Floyd Looks-For-Buffalo Hand, an Oglala Lakota Treaty Delegate and Elder, also an author and a spiritual leader in the indigenous Lakota religion, and who is also blood uncle to Lakota Freedom Delegation member Canupa Gluha Mani.	1
Sentence	4	The Lakota Freedom Delegation has claimed that, while the BIA-recognized tribal governments of the Lakota have not supported them, the Lakota Freedom Delegation's authority extends from support by the Treaty Council of the Elders of Lakota as well as from the 1974 International Indian Treaty Council.	1
Sentence	5	"There was no treaty withdrawal.	1
Sentence	6	It was three people."	0
Sentence	7	"Russell Means and Duane Martin [Canupa Gluha Mani] and that lady [Phyllis Young], they do not speak for the nation.	1
Sentence	8	You've got to have consensus" among the eight tribes of the Lakota, he said, which the Lakota Freedom Delegation has not obtained.	0
Sentence	9	Mr. Hand stated that he was speaking as a tribal delegate with the consensus of the Oglala Treaty Delegation and his chief, Oliver Red Cloud.	0
Sentence	10	Hand furthermore called the treaty withdrawal event a "publicity stunt" and that furthermore the 1974 meeting was not authorization to act on behalf of the Lakota people.	1
Sentence	11	While Means, Canupa Gluha Mani, and the rest of the delegation "have free speech" and can do as they wish, he said, the Elders of Lakota "stated that they should remove themselves from treaty territory," that is, the Reservations inhabited by the Lakota.	0
Sentence	12	But "they're still living here" (Canupa Gluha Mani has been residing in Asheville, North Carolina since the treaty withdrawal press conference on December 19).	0
Sentence	13	When asked if the above decisions represented the consensus of the whole Treaty Council, Hand stated, "we all do the same because we're all fullbloods.	1
Sentence	14	We all speak our own language."	0
Sentence	15	Hand went on to explain, though, that the Treaty Council was planning to reconsider the Lakota's arrangement with the United States government.	1
Sentence	16	The Treaty Council of all eight Lakota tribes, which will meet on 28–30 January 2008, will consider whether to "sit down to negotiate" with the federal government.	0
Sentence	17	Members of the Lakota Freedom Delegation are expected to take part in that meeting.	0
Sentence	18	European-Americans, Hand said, are "not honoring" the 1851 and 1868 treaties which connected the Lakota to the United States, and noted that the Lakota were the only people to "conquer" the United States during the Indian Wars of the 19th century.	0
Sentence	19	The arrangement with the United States, which he called a "contract", "handcuffs us through the federal programs".	1
Sentence	20	On their own, Hand said, "if we rely on a sovereign nation as a nation, relating to other nations with our economic development I think we can survive."	0
Sentence	21	Hand noted that one possibility under consideration was asserting the right to negotiate independently of the US government with foreign powers in areas such as airport access rights.	0
Sentence	22	The Lakota, he said, would charge foreign airlines half what the United States charges to make use of airports on Lakota soil.	0
Sentence	23	"We can be well off," he argued.	0
Sentence	24	In another contradiction of the Lakota Freedom Delegation's program, Hand said that the Treaty Delegations "don't want technology on our reservation".	1
Sentence	25	One of his concerns was environmentalism.	0

Article	11
Sentence	1	Four years ago, on February 9, a major Polish newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza published a report detailing a hoax in Polish Wikipedia entitled Henryk Batuta.	1
Sentence	2	The author of the report was Konrad Godlewski; several weeks later, Godlewski began editing Polish Wikipedia.	0
Sentence	3	The results of his work include one featured article – pismo chińskie (Polish for "Chinese character") – as well as various articles relating to China.	0
Sentence	4	During our interview, Godlewski discusses memes, hoaxes, and the Batuta Army – the creators of the hoax his paper reported on.	1
Sentence	5	From February this year, a special project on the Polish Wikipedia, BATUTA, saw a makeshift taskforce work on improving the quality of content.	0
Sentence	6	BATUTA stands for "Bezwzględna Akcja Troskliwego Uźródławiania Tysięcy artykłów", roughly translated as "Ruthless Action of Carefully Adding References to Thousands of Articles".	0
Sentence	7	((Wikinews))  You are the author of the first news story about the Henryk Batuta hoax, uncovered four years ago in the Polish Wikipedia.	1
Sentence	8	Do you remember when did the authors of the hoax first come to you?	0
Sentence	9	Was it just before the publication or earlier?	0
Sentence	10	The hoax was uncovered on January 20 and the story was published on February 9, so there was a period of time between those two dates...	0
Sentence	11	((Konrad Godlewski)) I found them myself.	1
Sentence	12	Accidentally.	0
Sentence	13	I was looking for new, interesting stories about the Internet.	0
Sentence	14	My newspaper colleague Robert Sankowski told me he had heard somewhere about a friend of a friend who had been doing some huge scam in Wikipedia.	0
Sentence	15	Step by step, I had traced that person.	0
Sentence	16	This was a few months before the publication, back in late 2005.	0
Sentence	17	A representative from Batuta's Army asked me to hold on with publication, even though the article had already been visible in Wikipedia for many months.	0
Sentence	18	((WN)) Did you follow the process of deletion of the article?	1
Sentence	19	((KG)) Yes, for the last few days.	1
Sentence	20	The Army from the very beginning wanted to test Wikipedia's defense mechanisms.	0
Sentence	21	It was then when I had a meeting with them and they told me about their views.	0
Sentence	22	They knew their hoax was nearing its end and they wanted to close it somehow.	0
Sentence	23	((WN)) In your story you wrote they wanted to show how thoughtless the people of Warsaw were when it came to names of streets and neighborhoods.	1
Sentence	24	Now it turns out it was more about Wikipedia and its mechanisms.	0
Sentence	25	((KG)) It was about a number of things at the same time.	1
Sentence	26	It was easy to notice the hoax was created by really smart people.	0
Sentence	27	Testing Wikipedia was one of the aspects of this entire thing.	0
Sentence	28	The second one was the attitude towards streets and generally Poland's communist past.	1
Sentence	29	As one could easily guess, Batuta's Army had rather right-wing political views, most probably close to IPN [e.d.	0
Sentence	30	note: Instytut Pamięci Narodowej/IPN, English: National Memory Institute is a governmental agency in Poland conducting both criminal investigations and scientific research into the country's communist past], which fights against communist streets' namesakes.	0
Sentence	31	And there was a third reason.	1
Sentence	32	As I'm sure you remember, in the 90s, conspiracy theories concerning Jews were popular in Poland.	0
Sentence	33	As some of the people of such origin had changed their names, the conspiracy theory made people see Jews nearly everywhere.	0
Sentence	34	Such lists were printed on paper and later they got published on the Internet.	0
Sentence	35	((WN)) It's a bit strange.	1
Sentence	36	Having right-wing views, the Army caused the right-wing websites, which copied the hoax from Wikipedia, to get discredited as an effect of this.	0
Sentence	37	((KG)) Not all right-wing people are uneducated individuals with antisemitic views.	1
Sentence	38	((WN)) The same IP number (which is dynamic but from a narrow range) which was used to create the hoax, is still being used today to edit Wikipedia.	1
Sentence	39	For example, quite recently someone tried to smuggle in a biography of "Hipolit Pieściuk – sculptor and social activist".	0
Sentence	40	Google shows no information on this biography.	0
Sentence	41	They've added just text, not an article.	0
Sentence	42	Does it mean they have not give up on Wikipedia?	0
Sentence	43	Your article in "Gazeta Wyborcza" ended with the words "Batuta's Army is asking for anonymity and claims that Henryk Batuta is not their last word".	0
Sentence	44	((KG)) I haven't heard about Hipolit.	1
Sentence	45	As far as I know, Batuta's case actually turned up to be their last word.	0
Sentence	46	As far as I know those people have made careers and they now have more serious things to care about.	0
Sentence	47	((WN)) So they don't want to reveal themselves?	1
Sentence	48	((KG)) I imagine it wouldn't look good in their CVs.	1
Sentence	49	There are people who think of such scam as a point of honor.	0
Sentence	50	I don't think that's the case with Batuta's Army.	0
Sentence	51	Anyway, this case had also had an effect on me.	0
Sentence	52	Before the Batuta story I had made a few trial editions in Wikipedia.	0
Sentence	53	But later something turned me on.	0
Sentence	54	I thought there was a group of idealistic people who want to make humanity happier with their meticulous work.	0
Sentence	55	And someone tried to make idiots of them.	0
Sentence	56	((WN)) So you've started to develop articles up to featured article standards.	1
Sentence	57	((KG)) Don't exaggerate.	1
Sentence	58	I've written just one such article.	0
Sentence	59	But thanks to this, I've realized how important Wikipedia had become.	0
Sentence	60	I don't think there is single journalist who doesn't use it.	0
Sentence	61	((WN)) Would you reveal your Wikipedia nickname?	1
Sentence	62	((KG)) Yes, it's actually my high school nickname – conew.	1
Sentence	63	Sadly, after some time I stopped.	0
Sentence	64	My family got bigger and I didn't have enough time to make all of humanity happier.	0
Sentence	65	((WN)) When we were talking soon after your publication, you wrote to me you had hoped there would be some positive effects of your story.	1
Sentence	66	Do you think you've initiated a landslide change?	0
Sentence	67	((KG)) I don't think it was a landslide.	1
Sentence	68	But still, I do acknowledge the fact that Batuta's case has become something of a milestone in the development of Wikipedia.	0
Sentence	69	I had a chance to about it with Jimmy Wales.	0
Sentence	70	It was in the time when the German Wikipedia was testing new, stricter editorial guidelines.	0
Sentence	71	However, I think the most important was the impact on the other side – the readers.	1
Sentence	72	Even the best editorial system lets some mistakes pass undetected.	0
Sentence	73	I know it, I've worked in several newspapers.	0
Sentence	74	Batuta's case reminds us the old truth: dubito ergo sum.	0
Sentence	75	There are mistakes in respected encyclopedias and books as well.	0
Sentence	76	Sometimes those are "Dawkins-like" mistakes, if you remember the chapter about memes in "The Selfish Gene".	0
Sentence	77	My favorite example is the one about Michał Boym, Polish Jesuit and one of the first sinologists.	1
Sentence	78	He had done a great job with his descriptions of Chinese plants and animals.	0
Sentence	79	His works were later published in Europe.	0
Sentence	80	Sometimes his text were stolen from him and published under other people's names.	0
Sentence	81	There was a case of "green-furred turtle".	0
Sentence	82	Boym wrote about it because it was extremely bizarre: a turtle with green fur.	0
Sentence	83	In fact it was a kind of seaweed growing on the turtle's shell.	0
Sentence	84	Boym described it in his Latin text as "viridium".	0
Sentence	85	And printers from Vienna made it "vindium" which can be translated as "floating in air".	0
Sentence	86	This slight typing mistake made people in the West believe there were flying turtles in China.	0
Sentence	87	What's more, there were pictures showing this unusual thing.	0
Sentence	88	((WN)) Batuta also started to mutate and it happened at the very beginning.	1
Sentence	89	((KG)) That's because Wikipedia's articles are the best example of memetics at work.	1
Sentence	90	The articles are like some living organisms transferred to a new environment – with time they evolve, adapting to the requirements such as neutral of point of view, proper language, verifiability and, most importantly, factual truth.	0
Sentence	91	((WN)) In the printed edition of "Gazeta Wyborcza" your text was accompanied by a photo, supposedly showing Henryk Batuta.	1
Sentence	92	It actually did not appear in the Wikipedia article, but even Jimbo mentioned that photo when he was explaining this situation to the journalists.	0
Sentence	93	((KG)) Oh yes.	1
Sentence	94	The photo was the idea of the editor of that day's edition.	0
Sentence	95	It's a petty it is now stuck somewhere in Gazeta'sarchives because it a really great job by the photo editor.	0
Sentence	96	Maybe Wikipedia should ask "Gazeta" for permission to use this little masterpiece.	0
Sentence	97	((WN)) When I read some recent texts about Batuta I often come across different mutations of the story.	1
Sentence	98	The most common is the one which says the journalists were the ones who uncovered the hoax, in spite of the fact that your text was published several days after the uncovering made by the Wikimedians themselves.	0
Sentence	99	((KG)) That's correct.	1
Sentence	100	It is quite common to attribute different things to the journalists because of their job which is to go around, look and investigate.	0
Sentence	101	I've seen Batuta being quoted in many publications on Wikipedia and the Internet.	0
Sentence	102	This is part of a broader problem of credibility of sources.	0
Sentence	103	It's horrifying but we are surrounded by the half-truths and lies.	0
Sentence	104	((WN)) Roman, Władysław, Marek – the names of the members of Batuta's Army were obviously false as well?	1
Sentence	105	((KG)) Yes, they were "alternative".	1
Sentence	106	((WN)) Was the term "Batuta's Army" created after you had already begun to talk?	1
Sentence	107	Or maybe they came to you already with this term?	0
Sentence	108	((KG)) Batuta's Army was invented by the hoax' creators as we spoke.	1
Sentence	109	Probably they wanted it to sound like some well-know political terrorist organizations like IRA or Red Army Faction.	0
Sentence	110	It was a kind of joke.	0
Sentence	111	((WN)) News about Batuta became a "good meme" and later it began to live a life of its own.	1
Sentence	112	Many legends originated from this story.	0
Sentence	113	Do you think it will become a "hard" urban legend?	0
Sentence	114	((KG)) I had thought so, but fortunately the Wikimedians woke up right in time and put an end to this.	1
Sentence	115	Today the original Batuta article is like an antibody in a vaccine – accompanied by a secure commentary, it can be used by anyone for the sake of his/her own immunity against such a "virus".	0
Sentence	116	However, another "Jewish conspiracy" theory is still thriving.	0
Sentence	117	It has something to do with Batuta's article, as in the hoax he was a communist activist with you-know-what origin.	0
Sentence	118	The theory I'm talking about was made popular by Okhrana (Russian secret police from the tzars times) with the publication of "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion".	0
Sentence	119	It has made its way as far as to Japan.	0
Sentence	120	Recently I've been following its spread in China.	0
Sentence	121	A book called "The Currency Wars" has recently been published there.	0
Sentence	122	The author used to work at American financial institutions.	0
Sentence	123	When he came back to China, he wrote the book describing how America's finances are under control by a group of friends with common ancestry.	0
Sentence	124	I don't think there's any way of defense against a good hoax.	0
Sentence	125	I'm sure at least a few such Batutas are hiding somewhere in Wikipedia.	0
Sentence	126	It's a classical evolutionary arms race.	0
Sentence	127	((WN)) When media published a story about a hoax concerning a false product (medicine for hangover), they praised the company for visionary marketing, despite the fact it came down to a deception.	1
Sentence	128	Why in the conflict between citizens and business, the media represents the corporations?	0
Sentence	129	((KG)) Sometimes they do and sometimes they don't.	1
Sentence	130	I don't think you can simplify it to such an extent.	0
Sentence	131	This is a chain: journalist – editor – publisher – owner.	0
Sentence	132	Each of the elements has its own motivations and there is little in common between them.	0
Sentence	133	That's maybe with the exception  of desire for profit.	0
Sentence	134	But there are also some journalists who work mainly for their ideals.	0
Sentence	135	I don't remember in detail that particular case, but a tendency to deceive is part of the human nature.	1
Sentence	136	What's more, people enjoy being deceived, they appreciate manipulation as long as it's witty and funny.	0
Sentence	137	One of the authors compared Batuta's case to provocations which are the basis of the modern conceptual art.	0
Sentence	138	The artist gets into the public space and shocks people in order to make them react, to make the viewer part of the game.	0
Sentence	139	((WN)) Maybe it's my oversimplification indeed.	1
Sentence	140	And maybe that's because Wikipedia itself is being perceived as if it was a corporation.	0
Sentence	141	I remember when Google's Knol was launched and one of the media stories called Knol David and Wikipedia Goliath.	0
Sentence	142	((KG)) It's a question of marketing and public relations.	1
Sentence	143	Google, as any modern company, spends a lot of money to create and maintain the image of both itself and its products.	0
Sentence	144	And Wikipedia is a bunch of Internet users who tries to set its own order by democratic means.	0
Sentence	145	It's part of democracies' nature that they need years to earn their own ethos, image and culture of organization.	0
Sentence	146	Just compare Polish and British democracy.	0
Sentence	147	((WN)) OK, so I classically thank you for talking to me.	1
Sentence	148	((KG)) Thank you.	1

Sentence	12	"We'll be kept away from it."	0
Sentence	13	A resident of eight years, two as shire president, Mr Thompson said he did not trust the federal Government because it ignored the concerns of the 1500-strong community.	1

Sentence	31	"We want to know exactly what the cost has been to unnecessarily fly these people over to Christmas Island and why, seeing that they managed to arrive within the accepted migration zone and should be processed here," Senator Bartlett said.	1

Sentence	49	It is part of the network of habitats of migratory species that Australia must protect under international agreements such as the Japan-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (JAMBA) and the China-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (CAMBA).	0

Sentence	51	Research has shown that Abbott's Boobies nesting within 300 m of clearings experience significantly lower breeding success than birds nesting further away.	1

Sentence	53	The centre, under construction since January this year, is not due to be operational until late 2006.	1
